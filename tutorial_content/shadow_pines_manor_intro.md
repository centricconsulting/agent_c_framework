# Shadow Pines Manor - Tutorial Introduction

## HOOK: The Mysterious Invitation

*The grandfather clock's steady tick echoes through Shadow Pines Manor as you step into the main hallway. Mist rolls past the tall windows, casting shifting shadows across generations of family portraits. Butler James approaches with measured steps, his weathered hands holding an ornate envelope.*

**James the Butler:** "Ah, you've arrived at last. Lord Pemberton left specific instructions before his... departure. He said you would come seeking answers." *His knowing eyes study you carefully.* "The manor holds many secrets, and I suspect you'll need to understand them all before this matter is resolved."

*He gestures toward the study with formal precision.* "Perhaps we should begin where Lord Pemberton spent his final evening - in his private study. There are things you must learn to navigate what lies ahead."

## OBJECTIVE: Uncover the Complete Secret

**Your Mission:** Shadow Pines Manor conceals an ancient mystery requiring two special keys to unlock. Lord Pemberton believed someone would eventually come to piece together the truth. Your task is to master the skills needed to uncover both keys and reveal the manor's deepest secret.

**James whispers:** "The family has kept these secrets for generations. But recent events suggest the time for hiding has passed. You must learn to see what others overlook, to search where others merely glance."
