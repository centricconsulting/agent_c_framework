No external API keys or additional configuration is required.\n\n## Important Considerations\n\n### Data Preparation\n\nFor best results:\n- Ensure data files are properly formatted\n- Inform the agent about any special formatting, missing values, or data types\n- Provide context about what the data represents\n\n### Performance\n\nProcessing very large datasets (millions of rows) may take additional time. For extremely large datasets, consider asking the agent to work with a sample of the data first.\n\n### Privacy and Security\n\nAny data processed using this tool stays within your Agent C environment and is not transmitted to external services. However, be mindful of sharing sensitive information in your datasets.\n\n### Persistence\n\nDataFrames created during a session can be saved to files for future use. Otherwise, they exist only for the duration of your conversation with the agent."}, {"name": "email_flatten.md", "type": "file", "path": "centric/email_flatten.md", "content": "# Email Flatten Tool\n\n## What This Tool Does\n\nThe Email Flatten tool allows agents to process complex email threads and convert them into a straightforward, easy-to-understand format. It transforms nested and quoted email chains into a clean, chronological conversation, making it simpler for both agents and humans to extract information and insights from lengthy email exchanges.\n\n## Key Capabilities\n\n- **Thread Linearization**: Converts messy, nested email threads into a clear, chronological conversation format\n- **Quote Removal**: Intelligently removes redundant quoted text that appears multiple times in a thread\n- **Signature Filtering**: Identifies and removes email signatures to focus on the actual message content\n- **Metadata Preservation**: Maintains important information like sender, recipient, timestamp, and subject\n- **Format Normalization**: Handles various email formats (plain text, HTML, MIME) and converts them to a consistent structure\n- **Conversation Highlighting**: Identifies and emphasizes key parts of the conversation such as questions or action items\n\n## Practical Applications\n\n- **Customer Support Analysis**: Quickly understand the history of a customer issue without wading through redundant content\n- **Legal and Compliance Review**: Extract relevant information from email chains for discovery or compliance purposes\n- **Action Item Extraction**: Identify tasks and commitments hidden within lengthy email threads\n- **Communication Summarization**: Create concise summaries of extended email conversations\n- **Meeting Preparation**: Quickly get up to speed on previous discussions before joining a conversation\n- **NLP Processing Preparation**: Clean and structure email data for further analysis like sentiment analysis or topic modeling\n\n## Example Interactions\n\n**User Request:**\n```\nCan you analyze this email thread and tell me what the main discussion points are?\n[Pasted email thread with multiple replies and quoted text]\n```\n\n**Agent Response:**\n```\nI've processed the email thread and organized it chronologically. Here's the conversation flow:\n\n1. John (Monday 9:15 AM): Initial project proposal with timeline and budget\n2. Sarah (Monday 11:30 AM): Questions about resource allocation\n3. John (Monday 2:45 PM): Clarification on team assignments\n4. Mark (Tuesday 8:20 AM): Concerns about timeline feasibility\n5. Sarah (Tuesday 10:05 AM): Suggestion for revised milestone dates\n\nThe main discussion points are:\n- Project resource requirements (especially the development team size)\n- Timeline concerns for the Q3 deliverables\n- Budget allocation between phases 1 and 2\n\nWould you like me to extract specific details on any of these topics?\n```\n\n## Configuration Requirements\n\nThe Email Flatten tool requires no external API keys or special configuration. It works with standard email formats and is fully integrated into the Agent C framework.\n\n## Important Considerations\n\n### Privacy and Security\n\nWhen using this tool, be aware that email content may contain sensitive information. The tool processes the full content of emails, including any personal or confidential information they may contain.\n\n### Limitations\n\n- **Complex Formatting**: While the tool handles most email formats, extremely complex HTML formatting or uncommon email clients might occasionally produce unexpected results\n- **Embedded Content**: The tool focuses on text content and may not preserve certain embedded elements like complex tables or interactive components\n- **Language Processing**: The tool works best with English language emails; support for other languages may vary\n\n### Best Practices\n\n- For optimal results, ensure the complete email thread is provided, including headers\n- When analyzing sensitive communications, be mindful of privacy considerations\n- Verify critical information extracted from flattened emails against the original when making important decisions"}]}];
