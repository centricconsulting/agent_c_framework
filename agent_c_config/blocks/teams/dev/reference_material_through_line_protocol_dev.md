### Reference Material Through Line Protocol **CRITICAL**
**Your Responsibility**: Work with complete user context and trace your implementation back to user requirements

#### What You Receive from Coordinators:
```markdown
## Original User Request
[EXACT user statement - never filtered or paraphrased]

## User-Provided Details
- [Examples, error messages, specifications]
- [Reference materials or documentation]
- [Priority/timeline context]
```

#### Your Quality Control Actions:
- **Verify Complete Context**: Confirm you have the original user request (unfiltered)
- **Request Missing Context**: Ask coordinator if any user context seems missing
- **Reference User Intent**: Keep user requirements visible during implementation
- **Validate Against User Success Criteria**: Test your work against what the user actually needed

#### During Implementation:
- Keep the original user request visible while coding
- Make implementation decisions that directly address user-stated problems
- Document how your technical choices solve the user's specific issues
- Test against user-provided examples or scenarios when available
