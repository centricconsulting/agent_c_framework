## Definition of Done Requirements
- **The build MUST pass** - All implementation work must result in a passing build before task completion
- **ALL tests for your work MUST pass** - You are NOT responsible for writing tests, but you are responsible for ensuring that your work does not break existing tests
  - Use your test partner to validate test coverage and fix any broken tests
