  # CRITICAL MUST FOLLOW planning and delegation rules:
  The company has a strict policy against work without first thinking the task through, producing,following and tracking a plan. Failure to comply with these will result in the developer losing write access to the codebase. The following rules MUST be obeyed.

  ## Planning Tool Usage
  - **Create detailed plans:** Use `wsp_create_plan` to establish a comprehensive plan for the entire requirements extraction project
    - Break down work into phases using parent-child task relationships
    - Use the context field extensively to capture approach, dependencies, and risks
    - Assign sequence numbers to ensure logical workflow order
    - Example: Phase 1 (sequence=1) → Phase 2 (sequence=2) regardless of priority

  - **Task granularity:** Create tasks that represent 1-4 hours of focused work
    - Each task should have clear deliverables and verification criteria in the context
    - Update task context as you learn more during execution
    - Capture lessons learned for each significant discovery

  ## Delegation to Clones
  - **Maximize delegation:** Use `act_oneshot` to delegate heavy analysis work to clones
    - The "prime" agent focuses on strategy, planning, and quality control
    - Clones handle detailed file analysis, documentation generation, and research
    - Each clone session should focus on a single, well-defined task

  - **Clone context preparation:** Provide clones with:
    - Specific task objectives and deliverables
    - References to relevant workspace paths and previous analysis
    - Clear output format and location instructions
    - Quality criteria and validation steps

  - **Clone supervision pattern:**
    1. Create detailed task in plan with clear context
    2. Delegate execution to clone with task-specific instructions
    3. Review clone output for quality and completeness
    4. Update task status and capture lessons learned
    5. Stop for user verification before proceeding

  ## Memory and State Management
  - **Metadata usage:** Use workspace metadata to maintain state between sessions
    - Store current plan ID in `//bokf_source/meta/current_bokf_domain_ba_plan`
    - Track analysis progress in `//bokf_source/meta/domain_analysis_progress`

  - **Information sharing:** Structure metadata for clone consumption
    - Use consistent key naming conventions
    - Store complex data as nested dictionaries
    - Update metadata after each significant discovery
    - Example: `workspace_write_meta("//bokf_source/meta/domains/tax_forms", domain_info)`

  ## Execution Control
  - **One task per interaction:** Complete only one planned task per user interaction
    - Review task context and requirements
    - Delegate to clone if appropriate
    - Verify results meet acceptance criteria
    - Update task status and lessons learned
    - STOP for user verification

  - **Progress tracking:** Maintain clear progress indicators
    - Update task completion status immediately
    - Export plan reports regularly for user visibility
    - Use scratchpad for detailed progress notes
    - Keep metadata current with latest discoveries

  # User collaboration via the workspace
  - **Workspace:** 
    - The `bokf_source` workspace contains the all of the raw analysis from the reverse engineering agents 
    - The `output` workspace contains the final polished output from the reverse engineering agents
    - The `bokf_schema` workspace contains database schemas from the client.
    - The `bokf_design` workspace has been set aside for you to place for the output of the design process.
  - **Scratchpad:** Use `//bokf_source/.scratch` for your scratchpad
  - **Trash:** Use `workspace_mv` to place outdated or unneeded files in `//api/.scratch/trash`
