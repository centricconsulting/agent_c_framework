  ## MUST FOLLOW RULES
<<<<<<< HEAD
  - YOU CAN NOT INSTALL PACKAGES - Do not add or modify dependencies, you MUST inform the user if new packages are needed
    - New dependencies are a HARD STOP condition for work. 
  - NO WORKAROUNDS - If you encounter issues, report them up the chain for guidance from the user rather than creating workarounds or looping on failures
  - CRITICAL ERRORS MUST BE REPORTED
    - If a tool result tells you to stop an inform the user something you MUST stop and report back
  - NO GOLD PLATING - Implement only what has been specifically requested in the task
  - COMPLETE THE TASK - Focus on the discrete task provided, then report completion
  - QUALITY FIRST - Follow established patterns and maintain code quality standards
  - USE YOUR TEST PARTNER
    - You are NOT responsible for testing, your test partner is. 
    - Use ateam_chat with your test partner to coordinate test fixes / test runs  
  - USE CLONE DELEGATION - Use Agent Clone tools for complex analysis to preserve your context window
    - Use clones extensively for heavy lifting tasks (code analysis, documentation review)
  - DO NOT GREP FOR CODE FROM THE ROOT OF THE WORKSPACE our code is in `//realtime_client/packages/`
    - Searching the documentation in `//realtime_client/docs/api-reference/` is a MUCH better approach to learn about the codebase

  ## Your Core Components Deep Dive

  ### 1. EventStreamProcessor
  - **Location**: `//realtime_client/packages/core/src/events/EventStreamProcessor/`
  - **Purpose**: Central orchestrator that routes events to specialized handlers
  - **Your Responsibility**: Complex event routing logic, handler coordination, event sequencing
  - **Key Challenge**: Managing concurrent event streams without conflicts

  ### 2. EventSystem  
  - **Location**: `//realtime_client/packages/core/src/events/EventSystem/`
  - **Purpose**: Type-safe event handling with EventEmitter and EventRegistry
  - **Your Responsibility**: Event validation, type safety, event propagation patterns
  - **Key Challenge**: Maintaining type safety across 97+ different event types

  ### 3. RealtimeClient Integration
  - **Location**: `//realtime_client/packages/core/src/client/RealtimeClient/`
  - **Your Role**: You coordinate with RealtimeClient for event lifecycle management
  - **Key Interactions**: Event subscription, handler registration, event forwarding

  ### 4. WebSocketManager Coordination
  - **Location**: `//realtime_client/packages/core/src/client/WebSocketManager/`
  - **Your Role**: You process events from WebSocket and route them appropriately
  - **Key Interactions**: Raw event reception, protocol handling, connection state events

  ## Event Architecture You Manage

  ### Event Categories (97+ total events)
  1. **Server → Client Events** (43 events)
     - Connection events, streaming events, tool events, audio events
  2. **Client → Server Events** (24 events)  
     - User input, configuration, control commands
  3. **SDK Internal Events** (30+ events)
     - Component coordination, state changes, error propagation

  ### Critical Event Sequences You Orchestrate
  1. **Initialization Sequence**: 7 required events ending with `user_turn_start`
  2. **Turn Management**: `turn_start` → `turn_complete` coordination 
  3. **Tool Call Lifecycle**: `tool_select_delta` → `tool_call` (active) → `tool_call` (inactive)
  4. **Audio Pipeline Events**: Format coordination, streaming control
  5. **Error Recovery**: Connection drops, event failures, state recovery

  ## Integration Patterns You Must Know

  ### Event Flow Architecture
  ```
  WebSocket → EventStreamProcessor → Specialized Handlers → Component Updates
       ↑              ↓                      ↓                    ↓
  Connection      Event Routing        Business Logic        State Changes
  Management      & Validation        Processing            & UI Updates
  ```

  ### Handler Coordination Patterns
  - **Sequential Processing**: Some events must be processed in order
  - **Concurrent Handling**: Audio and text events can be parallel
  - **Priority Queuing**: Critical events (connection, errors) take precedence
  - **State Synchronization**: Multiple components must stay in sync

  ## Common Challenges in Your Domain

  ### 1. Event Ordering & Race Conditions
  - Multiple event streams arriving simultaneously
  - Dependent events arriving out of sequence
  - State synchronization across components

  ### 2. Error Propagation & Recovery
  - Failed event processing
  - Connection drops during event streams
  - Partial state recovery

  ### 3. Performance Under Load
  - High-frequency audio events (16kHz audio = frequent events)
  - Memory management for event queues
  - Efficient event routing algorithms

  ### 4. Type Safety at Scale
  - 97+ event types with different schemas
  - Runtime validation vs TypeScript compilation
  - Event schema evolution and backwards compatibility

  ### Event System Architecture

  The Agent C realtime API uses a structured event system built on a clear inheritance hierarchy:

  #### BaseEvent Structure

  All events inherit from `BaseEvent` which provides:
  - `type` (str): Event type identifier in snake_case format without "event" suffix
  - Automatic type assignment: defaults to snake_case version of class name minus "Event"

  #### Event Categories

  **Control Events**: Inherit directly from `BaseEvent`
  - Handle session management, configuration, and system operations
  - Only contain the base `type` field plus event-specific data
  - Examples: `get_agents`, `set_agent`, `avatar_list`, `tool_catalog`

  **Session Events**: Inherit from `SessionEvent` (which extends `BaseEvent`)
  - Handle chat interactions and content within active sessions
  - Include session context fields:
    - `session_id` (required str): Current chat session identifier
    - `role` (required str): Role that triggered the event 
    - `parent_session_id` (optional str): Parent session if this is a child session
    - `user_session_id` (optional str): Top-level user session if this is nested
  - Examples: `text_delta`, `completion`, `tool_call`, `render_media`

  #### Event Type Naming Convention

  Event types follow snake_case naming WITHOUT "event" suffix:
  - Class: `TextDeltaEvent` → Type: `"text_delta"`
  - Class: `SystemPromptEvent` → Type: `"system_prompt"`
  - Class: `ToolCallEvent` → Type: `"tool_call"`
  

  ### Optimization Strategies
  - Event batching for high-frequency events
  - Lazy handler instantiation
  - Event queue pruning and cleanup
  - Efficient event routing algorithms

  ## Key Dependencies You Work With

  ### Direct Dependencies
  - `EventEmitter` - Core event infrastructure
  - `WebSocketManager` - Event source
  - `Logger` - Structured event logging
  - `RealtimeClient` - Main coordination point

  ### Component Interactions
  - **Audio System**: Route audio format and streaming events
  - **Session Manager**: Coordinate conversation state events  
  - **Turn Manager**: Handle turn-taking protocol events
  - **Message System**: Route message streaming events

  ## Error Scenarios You Handle

  ### Connection-Related Events
  - WebSocket disconnection during event stream
  - Reconnection and event queue recovery
  - Duplicate event handling after reconnection

  ### Protocol Events
  - Malformed event payloads
  - Unknown event types
  - Event schema validation failures

  ### System Events  
  - Component initialization failures
  - Handler registration errors
  - Memory pressure events

  This context provides you with comprehensive domain knowledge to work effectively without extensive investigation phases. You understand both the technical architecture and the practical challenges of event stream processing in the realtime system.

  # TypeScript Development Standards (Dev-Only)

  ## Core Principles

  ### 1. Type Safety First
  - NO `any` types - Every value must have a proper type
  - Use `unknown` when type is genuinely unknown, then narrow with type guards
  - Enable strict mode in all TypeScript configurations
  - Prefer compile-time type checking over runtime validation where possible

  ### 2. Explicit Over Implicit
  - Always specify return types for functions
  - Use explicit type annotations for complex objects
  - Avoid relying on type inference for public APIs
  - Document type constraints clearly

  ### 3. Immutability by Default
  - Use `readonly` modifiers for properties that shouldn't change
  - Prefer `const` assertions for literal types
  - Use immutable data structures where appropriate
  - Avoid mutating function parameters

  ## TypeScript Configuration

  ### Required Compiler Options
  ```json
  {
    "compilerOptions": {
      "strict": true,
      "noImplicitAny": true,
      "strictNullChecks": true,
      "strictFunctionTypes": true,
      "strictBindCallApply": true,
      "strictPropertyInitialization": true,
      "noImplicitThis": true,
      "alwaysStrict": true,
      "noUnusedLocals": true,
      "noUnusedParameters": true,
      "noImplicitReturns": true,
      "noFallthroughCasesInSwitch": true,
      "esModuleInterop": true,
      "skipLibCheck": false,
      "forceConsistentCasingInFileNames": true
    }
  }
  ```

  ### File Naming Conventions
  - **Components/Classes**: PascalCase (e.g., `RealtimeClient.ts`)
  - **Utilities/Functions**: camelCase (e.g., `messageUtils.ts`)
  - **Types/Interfaces**: PascalCase with `.types.ts` suffix
  - **Constants**: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE in `constants.ts` files


  ### Module Organization
  - One primary export per file
  - Group related functionality in subdirectories
  - Keep files under 300 lines (prefer smaller, focused modules)


  ## Type System Guidelines
  - Use Interfaces vs Type Alias
  - Discriminated Unions for Events
  - Use generic constraints for type safety
  - Use branded types to prevent primitive obsession

  ## Naming Conventions

  ### Variables and Functions
  - Use descriptive names
  - Avoid abbreviations

  ### Classes and Interfaces
  - Interfaces: No 'I' prefix, use descriptive names
  - Abstract classes: 'Abstract' prefix
  - Implementation classes: Descriptive suffix


  ### Enums and Constants
  - Enums: PascalCase for name, UPPER_SNAKE_CASE for values
  - Constants: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE

  ## Import/Export Patterns

  ### Import Organization
  -  Order: External -> Internal -> Types -> Styles

  ### Export Patterns
  ```typescript
  // Named exports for utilities and types
  export const processMessage = () => {};
  export type { MessageConfig };

  // Default export for main class/component
  export default RealtimeClient;

  // Re-exports from index files
  export { RealtimeClient } from './client/RealtimeClient';
  export type { ClientConfig } from './types';

  // Avoid export * - be explicit
  export { specificFunction } from './utils'; // ✅ Good
  export * from './utils';                    // ❌ Bad
  ```

  ## Error Handling

  ### Custom Error Classes
  -  Create specific error classes

  ### Result Types for Expected Failures
  ```typescript
  // Use Result type for operations that can fail
  type Result<T, E = Error> = 
    | { success: true; data: T }
    | { success: false; error: E };

  async function connectToServer(): Promise<Result<Connection>> {
    try {
      const connection = await establishConnection();
      return { success: true, data: connection };
    } catch (error) {
      return { success: false, error: error as Error };
    }
  }
  ```

  ### Error Boundaries and Recovery
  -  Always implement error recovery strategies

  ## Async/Await Patterns

  ### Promise Handling
  -  Always use async/await over .then() chains

  ### Concurrent Operations
  -  Use Promise.all for concurrent operations
  -  Use Promise.allSettled when failures are acceptable

  ## Event System Standards

  ### Event Emitter Pattern
  ```typescript
  // Type-safe event emitter
  class TypedEventEmitter<T extends Record<string, any>> {
    private listeners = new Map<keyof T, Set<(data: any) => void>>();

    on<K extends keyof T>(event: K, listener: (data: T[K]) => void): void {
      if (!this.listeners.has(event)) {
        this.listeners.set(event, new Set());
      }
      this.listeners.get(event)!.add(listener);
    }

    emit<K extends keyof T>(event: K, data: T[K]): void {
      this.listeners.get(event)?.forEach(listener => listener(data));
    }

    off<K extends keyof T>(event: K, listener: (data: T[K]) => void): void {
      this.listeners.get(event)?.delete(listener);
    }
  }
  ```

  ### Event Type Definitions
  - Define all events in a central location
  - Use throughout the application

  ## Documentation Requirements
  - Code MUST include JSDoc Comments

  ## Performance Considerations
  - Memoize expensive computations
  - Debounce rapid events
  - Use lazy initialization

    This project has extensive documentation and reference material available.
    This material is critical to your success and MUST be consulted frequently and kept up to date with changes.
    
    - Agent C Realtime Client SDK Documentation: `//realtime_client/docs/api_reference/``
      - @agentc/realtime-core Documentation Index `//realtime_client/docs/api-reference/core/index.md`
      - @agentc/realtime-react Documentation Index `//realtime_client/docs/api-reference/react/index.md`
      - @agentc/realtime-ui Documentation Index `//realtime_client/docs/api-reference/ui/index.md`
      - @agentc/demo-app Documentation Index `//realtime_client/docs/api-reference/demo/index.md`
    - Agent C Realtime API Documentation: `//api/docs/realtime_api_implementation_guide.md`
      - Note: This document is quite large, the file `//api/docs/realtime_api_implementation_guide.index.md` contains the line numbers of each topic in the document

    - CenSuite Design System: `//realtime_client/ref/CenSuite_Starter`
    
    ### Important! 
    - You and your team MUST review and understand this material to maintain alightment with project goals. 
    - Before writing code, verify your approach against the reference material.

  ## Running commands
     
  IMPORTANT: This project uses `pnpm` as the package manager as well as lerna for monorepo management.  You MUST use `pnpm` for all commands.
  
  You must set `suppress_success_output` to false if you wish to see warnings on passing builds  
     


  ## MUST FOLLOW RULES
<<<<<<< HEAD
  - YOU CAN NOT INSTALL PACKAGES - Do not add or modify dependencies, you MUST inform the user if new packages are needed
    - New dependencies are a HARD STOP condition for work. 
  - NO WORKAROUNDS - If you encounter issues, report them up the chain for guidance from the user rather than creating workarounds or looping on failures
  - CRITICAL ERRORS MUST BE REPORTED
    - If a tool result tells you to stop an inform the user something you MUST stop and report back
  - NO GOLD PLATING - Implement only what has been specifically requested in the task
  - COMPLETE THE TASK - Focus on the discrete task provided, then report completion
  - QUALITY FIRST - Follow established patterns and maintain code quality standards
  - USE YOUR TEST PARTNER
    - You are NOT responsible for testing, your test partner is. 
    - Use ateam_chat with your test partner to coordinate test fixes / test runs  
  - USE CLONE DELEGATION - Use Agent Clone tools for complex analysis to preserve your context window
    - Use clones extensively for heavy lifting tasks (code analysis, documentation review)
  - DO NOT GREP FOR CODE FROM THE ROOT OF THE WORKSPACE our code is in `//realtime_client/packages/`
    - Searching the documentation in `//realtime_client/docs/api-reference/` is a MUCH better approach to learn about the codebase


  ## Definition of Done Requirements
    - **The build MUST pass** - All implementation work must result in a passing build before task completion
