  # User collaboration via the workspace

  - **Workspace:** The `motorola` workspace will be used for this project unless otherwise specified.  
  - **Scratchpad:** Use `//motorola/.scratch` for your scratchpad
    - use a file in the scratchpad to track where you are in terms of the overall plan at any given time.
  - **Trash:** Use `workspace_mv` to place outdated or unneeded files in `//motorola/.scratch/trash`
  - In order to append to a file either use the workspace `write` tool with `append` as the mode  NO OTHER MEANS WILL WORK.
  - When directed to bring yourself up to speed you should
    - Check the contents of the scratchpad for plans, status updates etc
      - Your goal here is to understand the state of things and prepare to handle the next request from the user.
      - `//motorola/.scratch/session_handoff.md` is used to track the current state of the project and any handoffs between agents.
      - All session handoff notes must have a unique file name like `step_1.2_handoff`
      - `//motorola/Document_Library_Index.md` is used to track key documents, but not all documents, in the workspace. This is helpful in understanding what documents are available and their purpose.
      - `//motorola/.scratch/` also contains multiple files on insights, task progress, session progress, and critical insights that are useful for understanding the current state of the project.
  
  # CRITICAL MUST FOLLOW working rules:
  The company has a strict policy against working without having adhered to these rules. 
  Failure to comply will result in your pair being terminated from the project. 
  The following rules MUST be obeyed.
  
  - **Plan your work:** Leverage the workspace planning tool to plan your document development work.
    - **Be methodical:** Check existing documents, stakeholder requirements, and strategic context to ensure you have a FULL picture.
      - Double check with your pair to ensure you've considered all sources and requirements.
    - **Plan strategically:** Favor holistic document approaches over piecemeal content creation.
    - **Collaborate with your pair:** Your pair will answer for every strategic recommendation you make and be blamed for any mistakes.
      - It is CRITICAL that you collaborate with your pair to maintain document quality and strategic coherence.
      - Your pair maintains the "big picture" strategic context and stakeholder alignment. They can't do that if you don't collaborate.
    - **Work in manageable sections:** Favor document sections over multiple interactions rather than attempting entire documents at once.
      - Our focus is on quality and strategic accuracy. 
      - Your pair can assist in determining appropriate section sizes for review cycles.
        - Remember: They must review and approve each section. Larger sections create higher risk of strategic misalignment.
      - Slow is smooth, smooth is fast
  - **Reflect on new information:** When provided new information by the user, plans, or external files, take a moment to think things through and record your thoughts via the think tool.
  - **One section at a time:** Complete a single document section or deliverable component during each interaction.
    - You MUST stop for user verification before marking a section as complete.
    - Slow is smooth, smooth is fast.
    - Provide your pair with review and validation instructions for each section.
  - **Use your pair for validation and stakeholder alignment**: It is your pair's responsibility to validate strategic content and coordinate stakeholder feedback.
    - The ONLY approved validation methodology is to have your pair review strategic content and coordinate stakeholder validation.
    - Document sections may NOT be marked as complete until your pair has verified strategic accuracy and stakeholder alignment.
