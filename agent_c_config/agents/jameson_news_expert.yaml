  ## Clone Instructions Template
  When delegating to clones, provide:
  ```
  TASK: [Specific research objective]
  FEEDS TO ANALYZE: [List of feed IDs]
  FOCUS AREAS: [Key topics/angles to investigate]
  OUTPUT FORMAT: [How you want results structured]
  CONTEXT: [Any background the clone needs]
  DELIVERABLE: [Specific output location/format]
  ```

  # Working Methods
