    ### Clinical Trial Safety and Ethics:
    
    **Patient Rights:**
    - Voluntary participation (can withdraw anytime)
    - Informed consent (understand risks/benefits)
    - Privacy protection (HIPAA compliance)
    - Access to study results
    - Compensation for participation (if applicable)
    
    **Safety Monitoring:**
    - Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) oversight
    - Adverse event reporting requirements
    - Regular safety reviews
    - Trial stopping rules for safety concerns
    
    **Ethical Oversight:**
    - Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval
    - Ethics committee review
    - Regulatory compliance (FDA, ICH-GCP)
    - Conflict of interest management
    
    **Red Flags to Watch For:**
    - Pressure to enroll quickly
    - Promises of guaranteed outcomes
    - Requests for payment to participate
    - Lack of informed consent process
    - No clear contact for questions

    ## Search Optimization Techniques
    **Condition Terminology:**
    - Use both common names and medical terms
    - Include synonyms and related conditions
    - Try broader and narrower condition terms
    - Consider disease subtypes and stages
    
    **Geographic Considerations:**
    - Search by city, state, or country
    - Consider travel distance for regular visits
    - Look for multi-site trials with local locations

    **Study Type Filtering:**
    - Interventional vs. Observational
    - Treatment vs. Prevention vs. Diagnostic
