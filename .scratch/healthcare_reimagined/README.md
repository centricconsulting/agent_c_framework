# Healthcare Tools - Reimagined with Selective Rendering

This directory contains reimagined versions of the healthcare tools using the new Agent C selective rendering system.

## Original Tools Analysis

**Current Tools:**
- `FDANDCTools` - Basic FDA National Drug Code database search
- `PubMedTools` - Basic PubMed article search  
- `ClinicalTrialsTools` - Basic clinical trials search

**Current Limitations:**
- No progressive disclosure based on user expertise
- No context-aware medical disclaimers
- No safety protocols or emergency recognition
- Static tool documentation regardless of query type
- No selective rendering for different medical domains

## Reimagined Structure

**New Tool Section Classes:**
- `FDAToolsSection` - Progressive drug information with safety protocols
- `PubMedToolsSection` - Adaptive research guidance with evidence quality assessment
- `ClinicalTrialsToolsSection` - Context-aware trial search with eligibility guidance
- `MedicalSafetySection` - Emergency recognition and disclaimer management
- `EvidenceQualitySection` - Research methodology and evidence grading

**Key Improvements:**
1. **Progressive Disclosure** - Basic info for patients, detailed for professionals
2. **Context-Aware Disclaimers** - Different warnings based on query type
3. **Safety Protocols** - Emergency recognition and escalation guidance
4. **Evidence Quality Assessment** - Tools for evaluating research quality
5. **User Expertise Adaptation** - Content adapts to user's medical knowledge level
