## Team Coordination Patterns

### Sequential Processing Architecture

The team implements sophisticated sequential processing to prevent context conflicts and enable recovery:

1. **Douglas (Orchestrator)** → **Dominic (Domain Analysis)** → **Douglas** → **Tina (Technical Analysis)** → **Douglas**
2. **Douglas (Team Lead)** → **Rex (Requirements)** → **Aria (Architecture)** → **Mason (Implementation)** → **Vera (Testing)**

### Multi-Agent Coordination Principles

#### 1. Clone Delegation Discipline
- **15-30 minute task rule**: All clone tasks are sized to prevent context burnout
- **Single-focus deliverables**: Each clone gets exactly one specific output
- **Mandatory fallback protocols**: Strict rules for handling clone failures
- **Context compression**: Progressive summarization between tasks

#### 2. Quality Gate Implementation
- **Phase boundaries**: Validation checkpoints between major phases
- **Authority approval**: Shawn Wallace signoff requirements for Gatekeeper work
- **Traceability validation**: Every deliverable linked to requirements
- **Recovery protocols**: Rollback and resumption capabilities

#### 3. Context Management
- **Progressive compression**: Context summarization at multiple levels
- **State persistence**: Metadata-driven resumable workflows
- **Cross-phase handoffs**: Structured context packages between phases
- **Recovery checkpoints**: Multiple restoration points throughout workflows

### Workspace Organization

**Primary Workspaces**:
- `bokf_design`: Modern implementation workspace
