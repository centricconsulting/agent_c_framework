# Bob's Insurance Multi-Agent Team Workflow Documentation

## Overview

The Bob's Insurance multi-agent team is designed to handle specialized client requests for COBOL file processing, data extraction, and Excel file management. The team follows a sequential workflow pattern with a central orchestrator managing the process and ensuring quality delivery.

## Team Architecture

### Agent Composition

| Agent Role | Agent Name | Agent Key | Primary Function |
|------------|------------|-----------|------------------|
| **Orchestrator** | Gatekeeper | `gatekeeper_bobs` | Client interface, workflow coordination, quality assurance |
| **COBOL Specialist** | Cobol | `cobol_interpreter_bobs` | COBOL file interpretation and data extraction |
| **Data Analyst** | Dana | `data_extractor_bobs` | Insurance data extraction and processing |
| **File Manager** | Excel | `excel_manager_bobs` | Excel file creation and management |

### Team Design Principles

1. **Sequential Processing**: Each agent completes their work before handoff to maintain context control
2. **Clear Role Separation**: Each agent has distinct expertise and responsibilities
3. **Orchestrator Control**: Gatekeeper maintains overall workflow state and client communication
4. **Quality Gates**: Validation checkpoints between each major phase
5. **Recovery-First Design**: Each step is resumable after failure with proper state tracking
