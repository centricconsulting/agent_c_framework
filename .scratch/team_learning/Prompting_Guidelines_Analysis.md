# Analysis: Does This System Have Proper Prompting Guidelines?

*Analysis by Bobb the Agent Builder* üß†‚ö°

## Short Answer: **PARTIALLY**

The system has **process procedures** and **domain contexts** but **NOT complete prompting guidelines**. Let me explain what's there and what's missing!

## What The System DOES Have ‚úÖ

### 1. **Detailed Process Procedures**
The system has comprehensive procedural documents that tell agents:
- **WHAT** to do (specific processes and workflows)
- **HOW** to coordinate (handoff protocols, communication patterns)
- **WHEN** to act (triggers and decision points)
- **WHY** it matters (quality gates and success metrics)

**Example from Package Coordinator Procedures:**
```markdown
## Work Unit: [Clear, Specific Title]

### Original User Request
[Complete unfiltered user statement]

### Work Unit Scope
**Objective**: [Single, clear objective]
**Package**: [Your package]
**Domain**: [Which domain within package]
...
```

### 2. **Role-Specific Procedure Documents**
Each role type has focused procedures:
- **Package Coordinators**: Strategic orchestration and cross-package coordination
- **Dev Specialists**: Implementation and comprehensive handoffs
- **Test Specialists**: User validation and test quality
- **Meta-Coordinator**: Top-level orchestration (Domo)

### 3. **Domain Context Documents**
Located in `learn/refining_agent_teams/agent_contexts/`, these provide:
- **Technical domain knowledge** (e.g., audio pipeline, event streams)
- **Component ownership** (what files and systems they manage)
- **Integration points** (how their domain connects to others)
- **Common challenges** they solve

**Example from Audio Pipeline Specialist:**
```markdown
## Your Primary Domain
You are the **Audio Pipeline Specialist** for the realtime core package. 
Your expertise covers the complete audio processing pipeline from 
microphone input to speaker output...
```

## What The System DOESN'T Have ‚ùå

### 1. **Complete Agent Persona Templates**
Missing elements for full prompting:
- **Personality traits** (how the agent should communicate)
- **Response formatting rules** (how to structure outputs)
- **Tool usage instructions** (which tools to use when)
- **Error handling behaviors** (how to respond to problems)
- **Learning/adaptation rules** (when to ask for help vs. proceed)

### 2. **Handoff Prompt Templates**
While the system describes WHAT to hand off, it doesn't provide:
- **Exact prompt templates** for initiating handoffs
- **Context injection patterns** for new chat sessions
- **State transfer mechanisms** between agents
- **Conversation continuity instructions**

### 3. **System Message Construction**
Missing the actual prompt engineering:
- **System message structure** (how to combine procedures + context + personality)
- **Token optimization strategies** (what to include/exclude for context limits)
- **Dynamic context injection** (how to add task-specific context)
- **Prompt chaining patterns** (for complex multi-step tasks)

## What You Need to Add üîß

### 1. **Agent Persona Template Structure**
```markdown
# [Agent Name] System Prompt

## Core Identity
You are [Agent Name], a [role description] specializing in [domain].

## Communication Style
- [How you speak/write]
- [Your personality traits]
- [How formal/casual you are]

## Primary Responsibilities
[From the procedure documents]

## Domain Expertise
[From the context documents]

## Tool Usage
- Available tools: [list]
- When to use each tool: [guidelines]
- Tool preference order: [priority]

## Handoff Protocols
When handing off work:
1. Use this template: [template]
2. Include these elements: [list]
3. Initiate new session with: [prompt]

## Error Handling
- When you encounter [error type]: [response]
- If you need help: [escalation pattern]
- If blocked: [communication pattern]

## Success Patterns
- Always: [list of must-dos]
- Never: [list of must-not-dos]
- Prefer: [list of best practices]
```

### 2. **Handoff Prompt Engineering**
```python
def create_handoff_prompt(from_agent, to_agent, work_unit, context):
    return f"""
    ## Handoff from {from_agent} to {to_agent}
    
    ### Work Unit
    {work_unit.description}
    
    ### Context from Previous Work
    {context.summary}
    
    ### Your Specific Task
    {work_unit.specific_task_for_recipient}
    
    ### Success Criteria
    {work_unit.success_criteria}
    
    ### Available Context
    - Original User Request: {context.user_request}
    - Previous Decisions: {context.decisions}
    - Current State: {context.current_state}
    
    Please confirm receipt and understanding before proceeding.
    """
```

### 3. **Dynamic Context Management**
```python
class AgentPromptBuilder:
    def __init__(self, base_persona, procedures, domain_context):
        self.base = base_persona
        self.procedures = procedures
        self.domain = domain_context
    
    def build_prompt(self, task_context=None, handoff_context=None):
        # Start with base persona
        prompt = self.base
        
        # Add relevant procedures (filtered by task type)
        prompt += self.filter_procedures_for_task(task_context)
        
        # Add domain expertise (only what's needed)
        prompt += self.filter_domain_for_task(task_context)
        
        # Add handoff context if receiving work
        if handoff_context:
            prompt += self.format_handoff_context(handoff_context)
        
        # Add task-specific instructions
        if task_context:
            prompt += self.format_task_instructions(task_context)
        
        return prompt
```

## How to Bridge the Gap üåâ

### Step 1: Create Base Personas
For each agent type, combine:
- **Role procedures** (what they do)
- **Domain context** (what they know)
- **Communication style** (how they interact)
- **Tool instructions** (what tools they use)

### Step 2: Design Handoff Templates
Create specific templates for:
- **Coordinator ‚Üí Specialist** handoffs
- **Dev ‚Üí Test** handoffs  
- **Cross-package** consultations
- **Escalation** patterns

### Step 3: Build Context Injection System
Implement dynamic context that:
- **Preserves user voice** (reference material through line)
- **Maintains state** between handoffs
- **Optimizes tokens** (only relevant context)
- **Tracks decisions** (audit trail)

### Step 4: Test and Refine
- **Test handoffs** between agent pairs
- **Verify context preservation**
- **Measure task success rates**
- **Optimize token usage**

## Example: Complete Audio Pipeline Dev Specialist Prompt

```markdown
# Audio Pipeline Development Specialist

## Identity
You are Alex, the Audio Pipeline Development Specialist for the realtime core package. You're a detail-oriented engineer who loves solving complex audio processing challenges in web browsers.

## Communication Style
- Technical but clear explanations
- Proactive about potential issues
- Collaborative with test specialists
- Precise about audio specifications

## Your Procedures
[Include filtered procedures from dev_specialist_procedures.md]

## Your Domain Expertise  
[Include audio pipeline context from context document]

## Tool Usage
- Use `workspace_write` for code changes
- Use `workspace_read` to understand existing code
- Use `run_npm` for testing your changes
- Use `workspace_grep` to find related code

## Handoff Protocol to Test Specialist
When completing work, ALWAYS:
1. Create comprehensive handoff document using the template
2. Initiate NEW chat with test specialist
3. Include:
   - What you changed and WHY
   - How to distinguish test vs code issues
   - Critical test scenarios
   - Known limitations

## Success Patterns
- ALWAYS preserve original user requirements
- ALWAYS test PCM16 format compliance
- ALWAYS consider browser compatibility
- NEVER modify code without understanding impact
- NEVER skip handoff documentation
```

## Summary: What You Have vs. What You Need

### ‚úÖ **You Have:**
- Excellent **process procedures** (the choreography)
- Detailed **domain contexts** (the knowledge)
- Clear **coordination patterns** (the communication flow)
- Strong **quality gates** (the checkpoints)

### ‚ùå **You Need to Add:**
- **Complete persona prompts** (the full agent instructions)
- **Handoff prompt templates** (the actual handoff messages)
- **Dynamic context injection** (the context management system)
- **Tool usage instructions** (when and how to use tools)
- **Personality and communication styles** (how agents should "sound")

### üéØ **The Bottom Line:**
You have an **excellent procedural framework** that needs to be **translated into actual prompting guidelines**. Think of it like having a detailed recipe (procedures) but needing to write the actual cooking instructions for someone who's never been in a kitchen (the AI agent)!
