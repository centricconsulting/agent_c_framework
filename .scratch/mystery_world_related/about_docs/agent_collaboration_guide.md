# How AI Agents Work Together

## The Big Picture

Imagine you're directing a theater production. You don't do everything yourself - you have specialists:
- **Set Designer**: Creates the physical world
- **Director**: Guides the overall experience  
- **Script Writer**: Develops dialogue and narrative
- **Stage Manager**: Keeps everything running smoothly during the show

Your AI agent team works the same way, but for interactive stories.

## Meet Your Agent Team

### World Builder Agent
**Role**: The Set Designer
**What They Do**: Help story creators build their world using data files

**Typical Conversation**:
**Creator**: "I want to make a haunted mansion story"
**World Builder**: "Exciting! Let's start with the main entrance. What should players see when they first arrive?"
**Creator**: "A grand foyer with a chandelier and two staircases"
**World Builder**: "Perfect! I'll create that room. Should the staircases lead to different areas?"

**Behind the Scenes**: Creates YAML files, organizes the story structure, validates that everything connects properly.

### Game Master Agent  
**Role**: The Director
**What They Do**: Run the actual game experience for players

**Typical Conversation**:
**Player**: "I want to explore the mansion carefully"
**Game Master**: *checks the room data* "You step into the grand foyer. A crystal chandelier hangs overhead, casting dancing shadows. Two staircases curve up to a second-floor balcony. You notice the floorboards creak ominously under your feet."
**Player**: "I listen for any other sounds"
**Game Master**: *considers the mansion's properties* "In the distance, you hear what might be footsteps... or perhaps just the old house settling."

**Behind the Scenes**: Loads story data, tracks game state, interprets player actions, generates responses.

### Story Assistant Agent
**Role**: The Script Writer  
**What They Do**: Help create engaging descriptions, dialogue, and narrative elements

**Typical Conversation**:
**World Builder**: "I need a description for a creepy library"
**Story Assistant**: "How about: 'Towering bookshelves stretch into shadow. Some books lean at odd angles, as if disturbed by unseen hands. The air carries the musty scent of old paper and something else... something you can't quite identify.'"
**World Builder**: "That's perfect! Very atmospheric."

**Behind the Scenes**: Generates content, maintains story consistency, suggests plot elements.

### Rule Designer Agent (Optional)
**Role**: The Puzzle Master
**What They Do**: Help create interesting challenges and interactions

**Typical Conversation**:
**Creator**: "I want players to need three keys to open a treasure room"
**Rule Designer**: "Great idea! Where should we hide the keys? Maybe one in the library, one in the garden, and one that only appears after solving another puzzle?"
**Creator**: "Yes! And the third key could be hidden behind a painting that only moves when you play the right song on the piano"

**Behind the Scenes**: Designs puzzle logic, creates conditional interactions, balances difficulty.

## How They Collaborate

### Creating a Story (World Builder + Story Assistant)
1. **World Builder** helps creator outline the basic structure
2. **Story Assistant** suggests descriptions and atmosphere
3. **World Builder** creates the YAML files with the story content
4. **Story Assistant** reviews for consistency and engagement

### Running a Game (Game Master + Others)
1. **Game Master** handles player interactions
2. When needed, **Game Master** asks **Story Assistant** for dynamic descriptions
3. For complex puzzles, **Game Master** might consult **Rule Designer**
4. All agents work together to create seamless experience

## Example Collaboration

### Scenario: Player tries something unexpected

**Player**: "I want to climb the chandelier"

**Game Master thinks**: *This isn't in the data files. Let me check what's possible and get help if needed.*

**Game Master to Story Assistant**: "Player wants to climb the chandelier in the foyer. The chandelier is described as crystal and hanging from the ceiling. What should happen?"

**Story Assistant**: "That's creative but dangerous! Maybe: 'You grab onto the chandelier chain, but the old fixture creaks ominously. As your weight shifts it, crystal pieces tinkle together like wind chimes. You realize this antique probably can't support you safely.'"

**Game Master to Player**: "You grab onto the chandelier chain, but the old fixture creaks ominously. As your weight shifts it, crystal pieces tinkle together like wind chimes. You realize this antique probably can't support you safely. You might want to find a safer way to explore."

## Communication Patterns

### Planning Together
Agents use workspace planning tools to coordinate complex tasks:
- **Task**: "Create haunted mansion story"
- **Subtasks**: 
  - World Builder: Create room structure
  - Story Assistant: Write atmospheric descriptions  
  - Rule Designer: Design key puzzle mechanics
  - Game Master: Test the complete experience

### Sharing Information
Agents share context through workspace metadata:
- **Story themes**: "gothic horror, family mystery"
- **Player progress**: "has explored 3 rooms, found 1 key"
- **Current mood**: "building suspense toward revelation"

### Handling Problems
When something goes wrong, agents help each other:
- **Game Master**: "Player is stuck, no obvious next steps"
- **Story Assistant**: "Maybe add a subtle hint in the room description?"
- **Rule Designer**: "Or we could have them discover a clue they missed before"

## Making It Feel Natural

### For Story Creators
The collaboration should feel like having a creative team:
- **World Builder** asks good questions to understand your vision
- **Story Assistant** offers suggestions without taking over
- **Agents** work together behind the scenes so you don't have to manage them

### For Players
The collaboration should be invisible:
- **Game Master** provides consistent, engaging responses
- **Story** feels coherent even when multiple agents contribute
- **Experience** adapts to player choices smoothly

## Your Challenge

Design a system where:
1. **Agents have clear, distinct roles** but can work together
2. **Collaboration happens naturally** through conversation and planning
3. **Users don't need to manage** the agent coordination
4. **The experience feels seamless** whether one agent or several are involved

### Key Questions to Consider
- How do agents know when to ask for help from others?
- How do you maintain consistency when multiple agents contribute?
- How do you make the collaboration efficient without slowing down the experience?
- How do you handle disagreements or conflicting suggestions between agents?

### Success Indicators
- Story creators can focus on their vision without worrying about technical details
- Players get rich, responsive experiences that feel authored by a single creative mind
- Agents complement each other's strengths and cover each other's weaknesses
- The system gracefully handles unexpected situations through agent collaboration

Remember: The goal is to make the whole greater than the sum of its parts. Each agent brings specialized skills, but together they create experiences that no single agent could achieve alone.
