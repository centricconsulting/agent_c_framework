# Mystery World Director Connectivity Fix - COMPLETED

## âœ… Problem Resolved

The Mystery World Director connectivity issue has been successfully resolved by moving the game master agents to the correct location and fixing their categorization.

## âœ… Actions Taken

### 1. Moved Game Master Agents
Successfully moved all three game master agents from their story directories to the main agents directory:

**FROM:**
- `//project/mystery_world/stories/Shadow_Pines/Shadow_Pines_Game_Master.yaml`
- `//project/mystery_world/stories/Space_Station/Space_Station_Game_Master.yaml` 
- `//project/mystery_world/stories/Victorian/Victorian_Game_Master.yaml`

**TO:**
- `//project/agent_c_config/agents/shadow_pines_game_master.yaml`
- `//project/agent_c_config/agents/space_station_game_master.yaml`
- `//project/agent_c_config/agents/victorian_game_master.yaml`

### 2. Fixed Agent Categories
Changed all three game masters from `domo` category (user-facing) to appropriate assistant categories:

**Mystery World Director:** âœ… REMAINS "domo" (user-facing entry point)
- Categories: `["domo", "gaming", "mystery"]`

**Game Masters:** âœ… NOW ASSISTANT AGENTS
- Shadow Pines: `["mystery", "gaming", "assistant"]`
- Space Station: `["mystery", "gaming", "assistant", "sci-fi"]`
- Victorian: `["mystery", "gaming", "assistant", "victorian"]`

### 3. Maintained Story Data Access
âœ… **Story data remains in original locations** where it belongs:
- World definitions, room files, object files stay in `mystery_world/stories/`
- Game masters can access via WorkspaceToolset using paths like `//project/mystery_world/stories/Shadow_Pines/shadow_pines_manor.yaml`

## âœ… Expected Results

The Mystery World Director should now be able to successfully:
1. **Connect to shadow_pines_game_master** âœ…
2. **Connect to space_station_game_master** âœ…
3. **Connect to victorian_game_master** âœ…

Users will interact with the Mystery World Director (the only "domo" agent), which will then route them to the appropriate specialist game master agents as needed.

## âœ… System Architecture Confirmed

**User Flow:**
1. User contacts `Mystery World Director` (domo agent)
2. Director recommends appropriate mystery world
3. Director routes user to specialist game master via Agent Assist tools
4. Game master orchestrates mystery experience using story data files
5. Game master can delegate to dialogue coordinators and assistants as needed

## âœ… No Data Loss or Duplication

- âœ… All story data remains in logical locations
- âœ… No files were deleted or lost  
- âœ… Game masters maintain full access to their resources
- âœ… Clean separation between user-facing and assistant agents

## ðŸ”§ Optional Cleanup

There is a duplicate `Space_Station_Game_Master.yaml` in the `mystery_world_test` directory that still has the old "domo" category, but this won't interfere since agent keys must be unique and the system will use the one in the main agents directory.

The connectivity issue should now be completely resolved!
