## Core Process Principles

### 1. **Reference Material Through Line**
**Original user requests and context flow unfiltered to every participant**
- No filtering or paraphrasing of user requirements
- Complete context preservation through all coordination layers
- Direct traceability from implementation back to user needs

### 2. **Design-First Development**
**All new features require comprehensive design and human signoff before implementation**
- Cross-package design collaboration required
- Technical feasibility validation by specialists
- Mandatory human approval before any implementation begins

### 3. **Work Unit Management**
**Each work unit equals a Scrum card in a dedicated chat session**
- 1-3 day scope with single focused objective
- New chat session per work unit (no reuse)
- Complete context provided upfront to specialists

### 4. **Dev-to-Test Handoff Excellence**
**Dev specialists create comprehensive handoff packages enabling precise issue classification**
- Detailed implementation context and rationale
- Clear distinction between test issues vs code issues
- Test specialist can immediately understand what changed and why

### 5. **Cross-Package Coordination**
**Explicit coordination protocols for work spanning multiple packages**
- Impact assessment and coordination planning required
- Sequential or parallel development patterns as appropriate
- Clear integration points and testing strategies

### 6. **Built-In Quality Control**
**Quality gates at every process stage with continuous improvement**
- Requirements, design, implementation, and testing quality layers
- Metrics-driven process improvement
- Regular quality retrospectives and process refinement

## Process Flow Summary

### Phase 1: Requirements & Design
1. **User Request** → Package Coordinators (complete unfiltered context)
2. **Cross-Package Impact Assessment** → All affected coordinators collaborate
3. **Design Process** → All packages participate in technical design
4. **Human Signoff** → Mandatory approval before implementation begins

### Phase 2: Implementation Coordination  
1. **Work Unit Creation** → Coordinators break work into Scrum card equivalents
2. **Specialist Assignment** → Dev specialists receive complete context in new chat sessions
3. **Cross-Package Coordination** → Coordinators manage dependencies and integration
4. **Progress Monitoring** → Regular check-ins prevent scope creep

### Phase 3: Development & Testing
1. **Implementation** → Dev specialists complete work within defined scope
2. **Handoff Package** → Comprehensive implementation context for testing  
3. **Test Execution** → Test specialists validate and extend test coverage
4. **Issue Resolution** → Clear classification and resolution of test vs code issues

### Phase 4: Quality Assurance & Delivery
1. **Cross-Package Integration** → Integration testing across package boundaries
2. **User Requirement Validation** → Verify original user needs are met
3. **Quality Review** → Coordinator approval and quality gate validation
4. **Delivery** → Complete feature delivery with documentation updates

## Success Criteria

### User Outcome Quality
- User requirements preserved and addressed throughout entire process
- Original user context traceable through all implementation decisions
- User success criteria demonstrably met in final delivery

### Process Effectiveness
- Work units complete within estimated timeframes (1-3 days)
- Cross-package coordination prevents integration issues
- Quality gates prevent downstream rework and user impact

### Team Efficiency  
- Specialists receive complete context upfront, minimizing investigation overhead
- Clean handoffs between dev and test specialists
- Effective cross-package coordination minimizes blocking issues

### Continuous Improvement
- Quality metrics tracked and improved over time
- Process refinements based on team feedback and outcomes
- Knowledge sharing and best practice propagation across teams

## Getting Started

### For Package Coordinators
1. Review your package coordinator context file
2. Understand cross-package dependencies and coordination points
3. Master work unit creation and specialist assignment protocols
4. Practice cross-package impact assessment and coordination

### For Specialists  
1. Review your specialist domain context file
2. Understand handoff protocols (dev ↔ test)
3. Know when and how to consult other package coordinators
4. Master the tools and patterns specific to your domain

### For Cross-Package Work
1. Always start with impact assessment
2. Involve all affected package coordinators in planning
3. Define clear integration points and testing strategies
4. Use established coordination patterns (sequential, parallel, emergency)
