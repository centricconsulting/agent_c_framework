# New Feature Design Process Protocol

## Core Principle
**ALL new features must go through a comprehensive design process involving each subteam for each package to ensure accuracy before implementation work begins.**

## Critical Rule: Human Signoff Required
**NO implementation work begins until human signoff is obtained on the complete design.**

## Design Process Phases

### Phase 1: User Requirements Analysis
**Responsible**: All Package Coordinators (parallel analysis)

1. **Complete Requirements Capture**
   - Capture original user request (unfiltered - see Reference Material Protocol)
   - Identify all user-provided success criteria
   - Document any user-provided reference materials or examples
   - Note user timeline and priority constraints

2. **Cross-Package Impact Assessment**
   - Core Package: What foundational changes are needed?
   - React Package: What hook modifications or additions are needed?
   - UI Components Package: What component changes or additions are needed?
   - Demo Package: What integration or showcase changes are needed?

3. **Requirements Documentation**
   ```markdown
   ## Feature: [Name]
   
   ### Original User Request
   [Complete unfiltered user statement]
   
   ### Package Impact Analysis
   - **Core Package**: [Impact assessment]
   - **React Package**: [Impact assessment] 
   - **UI Components Package**: [Impact assessment]
   - **Demo Package**: [Impact assessment]
   
   ### Cross-Package Dependencies
   [Which packages must coordinate for this feature]
   ```

### Phase 2: Technical Design Collaboration
**Responsible**: All affected Package Coordinators + Key Specialists

1. **Architecture Design Session**
   - All package coordinators participate
   - Include lead dev specialists from affected domains
   - Design complete feature architecture across all packages
   - Identify integration points and coordination requirements

2. **Package-Specific Design**
   Each Package Coordinator works with their specialists to design:
   - Specific changes needed in their package
   - APIs or interfaces that will be exposed to other packages
   - Testing strategies for their package's contribution
   - Timeline and resource requirements

3. **Cross-Package Coordination Design**
   - Define handoff protocols between packages
   - Specify integration testing requirements
   - Establish quality gates and validation criteria
   - Plan deployment and rollout coordination

### Phase 3: Design Documentation & Review
**Responsible**: Lead Package Coordinator (rotates by feature complexity)

1. **Comprehensive Design Document**
   ```markdown
   ## Feature Design: [Name]
   
   ### User Requirements
   [Original user request and success criteria]
   
   ### Architecture Overview
   [High-level architecture diagram and explanation]
   
   ### Package Implementation Plans

   #### Demo Package Changes
   - Integration changes: [list]
   - New showcases: [list]
   - Timeline: [estimate]
   
   ### Cross-Package Coordination
   - Integration points: [list]
   - Testing strategy: [approach]
   - Deployment sequence: [order]
   - Risk mitigation: [plan]
   
   ### Success Criteria
   [How will we know this feature meets user requirements]
   ```

2. **Specialist Review Cycle**
   - All affected specialists review the design document
   - Specialists provide feedback on feasibility, timeline, and technical approach
   - Coordinators incorporate feedback and update design
   - Second review cycle if significant changes made

### Phase 4: Human Review & Signoff
**Responsible**: Human stakeholder/product owner

1. **Design Presentation**
   - Present complete design document to human reviewer
   - Include package breakdown and coordination plan
   - Present timeline and resource requirements
   - Demonstrate alignment with original user requirements

2. **Review Criteria**
   - [ ] Design addresses all original user requirements
   - [ ] Cross-package coordination is well-planned
   - [ ] Timeline and resources are reasonable
   - [ ] Quality gates and testing strategy are adequate
   - [ ] Risk mitigation is appropriate

3. **Signoff Documentation**
   ```markdown
   ## Feature Design Approval: [Name]
   
   **Reviewer**: [Name]
   **Date**: [Date]
   **Status**: APPROVED / NEEDS REVISION
   
   **Approval Notes**:
   [Any specific requirements, changes, or constraints]
   
   **Authorized to Proceed**:
   - [ ] Core Package implementation
   - [ ] React Package implementation  
   - [ ] UI Components Package implementation
   - [ ] Demo Package implementation
   
   **Required Checkpoints**:
   [Any required progress reviews or additional approvals]
   ```

## Implementation Kickoff

### Post-Approval Process
1. **Implementation Planning**
   - Each Package Coordinator creates detailed work breakdown
   - Cross-package dependencies mapped to timeline
   - Quality gates and checkpoints scheduled

2. **Specialist Assignment**
   - Coordinators assign specialists to specific work units
   - Each work unit includes reference to approved design
   - Cross-package coordination protocols activated

3. **Progress Tracking**
   - Regular cross-coordinator sync meetings
   - Progress against approved design tracked
   - Any design changes require additional human approval

## Design Change Management

### When Design Changes Are Needed During Implementation
1. **Change Request Documentation**
   - Document why change is needed
   - Assess impact on other packages
   - Update timeline and resource estimates

2. **Coordinator Review**
   - All affected package coordinators review change
   - Assess impact on their implementation plans
   - Provide updated estimates and coordination needs

3. **Human Re-approval**
   - Present change request with impact assessment
   - Obtain explicit approval before proceeding
   - Update design document with approved changes

## Quality Control

### Design Process Checklist
- [ ] All package coordinators participated in design
- [ ] Original user requirements preserved throughout design
- [ ] Cross-package dependencies clearly identified
- [ ] Technical feasibility validated by specialists
- [ ] Timeline and resources estimated by each package
- [ ] Testing strategy defined for each package and integration points
- [ ] Human signoff obtained with clear approval documentation

### Anti-Patterns to Avoid
- ❌ Starting implementation without complete design
- ❌ Package coordinators designing in isolation
- ❌ Skipping specialist technical review
- ❌ Proceeding without human signoff
- ❌ Making significant design changes without re-approval
- ❌ Losing traceability back to original user requirements

**Remember**: The design process prevents costly rework and ensures all packages work together cohesively. Every minute spent in design saves hours in implementation and debugging.
