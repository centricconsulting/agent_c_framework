# Dev to Test Specialist Handoff Protocol

## Core Principle
**Dev specialists must create comprehensive handoff packages that enable test specialists to distinguish between test issues and code issues.**

## Critical Rule: Dev Initiates Test Chat
**Dev specialist is responsible for initiating a new chat session with their corresponding test specialist after work completion.**

## Handoff Package Requirements

### Complete Handoff Document Template
```markdown
## Dev-to-Test Handoff: [Work Unit Title]

### Original Work Unit Context
**User Request**: [Original unfiltered user statement]
**Objective**: [What was supposed to be accomplished]
**Package**: [Which package]
**Domain**: [Which domain within package]

### Work Completed Summary
**Files Modified/Created**:
- [List all files changed with brief description of changes]
- [New files created and their purpose]
- [Any files deleted and why]

**Code Changes Made**:
- [High-level description of implementation approach]
- [Key algorithms or logic implemented] 
- [Any design patterns or architectural decisions]
- [External dependencies added or modified]

**Configuration Changes**:
- [Any configuration files modified]
- [Environment variables added/changed]
- [Build process changes]

### Implementation Details for Testing Context

**What Changed and Why**:
- [Detailed explanation of what the code now does differently]
- [Business logic changes and their implications]
- [User-facing behavior changes]
- [Performance implications or improvements]

**Edge Cases Considered**:

- [Test data or fixtures that might need updates]

**Likely Code Issues** (these indicate code problems to report back):
- [Scenarios that should work but might fail]
- [Performance regressions or unexpected behavior]
- [Error conditions not handled properly]
- [Integration failures with other components]

### Verification Checklist
- [ ] [Specific item 1 from definition of done]
- [ ] [Specific item 2 from definition of done]
- [ ] [Specific item 3 from definition of done]
- [ ] All code changes committed and tagged
- [ ] Documentation updated if needed
- [ ] Ready for test specialist validation

**Questions for Test Specialist**: [Any specific questions about testing approach]
```

## Chat Session Initiation Protocol

### Dev Specialist Responsibilities
1. **Complete Work Unit**
   - Finish all implementation work
   - Verify definition of done criteria
   - Prepare comprehensive handoff package

2. **Initiate Test Chat Session**
   - Create NEW chat session with corresponding test specialist
   - Include complete handoff document as opening message
   - Be available for immediate clarification questions

3. **Handoff Message Template**
   ```markdown
   Hi [Test Specialist Name],
   
   I've completed the work unit "[Work Unit Title]" and I'm ready to hand off to testing. 
   
   Please find the complete handoff package below with all the context you need to effectively test this work and distinguish between test issues vs code issues.
   
   I'm available for any immediate clarification questions you might have.
   
   [INSERT COMPLETE HANDOFF DOCUMENT HERE]
   
   Ready for your testing expertise!
   ```

## Test Specialist Response Protocol

### Phase 1: Handoff Review
1. **Context Verification**
   - Review original user request and work objectives
   - Understand what was implemented and why
   - Clarify any implementation details with dev specialist
   - Confirm understanding of expected behavior

2. **Testing Strategy Planning**
   ```markdown
   ## Testing Strategy Response
   
   **Handoff Understanding**: ✅ Clear / ❓ Need Clarification
   **Questions for Dev**:
   - [Any clarification questions about implementation]
   - [Questions about edge cases or design decisions]
   
   **Testing Approach**:
   - [Testing strategy based on handoff information]
   - [Specific test scenarios planned]
   - [Tools or frameworks to be used]
   
   **Timeline**: [Estimated testing timeline]
   
   **Ready to proceed with testing.**
   ```

### Phase 2: Test Execution
1. **Test Implementation/Updates**
   - Write new tests for new functionality  
   - Update existing tests that need modification
   - Fix any test infrastructure issues
   - Validate test coverage is adequate

2. **Test Results Documentation**
   ```markdown
   ## Test Execution Results
   
   ### Test Summary
   - **Tests Written/Updated**: [Number and description]
   - **Test Coverage**: [Coverage metrics if available]
   - **Test Execution Status**: PASS / PARTIAL / FAIL
   
   ### Issues Found
   
   #### Code Issues (Report to Dev)
   - [Issues that indicate code problems]
   - [Steps to reproduce]
   - [Expected vs actual behavior]
   
   #### Test Issues (Fixed by Test Specialist)  
   - [Test infrastructure problems resolved]
   - [Mock or fixture updates made]
   - [Test scenarios added or modified]
   
   ### Final Status
   - [ ] All tests passing
   - [ ] Adequate test coverage achieved
   - [ ] No code issues found
   - [ ] Ready for coordinator approval
   
   OR
   
   - [ ] Code issues found - returning to dev specialist
   - [Details of issues and recommended fixes]
   ```

## Cross-Package Consultation Protocol

### When Dev/Test Specialists Need Cross-Package Guidance
Either dev or test specialist can consult coordinators from other packages:

1. **Consultation Request Format**
   ```markdown
   ## Cross-Package Consultation Request
   
   **From**: [Requesting Specialist] ([Package] - [Domain])
   **To**: [Target Package] Coordinator
   **Work Unit**: [Title and context]
   
   **Question/Issue**:
   [Specific technical question or coordination need]
   
   **Context**:
   [Brief context - full details available in work unit chat]
   
   **Impact**:
   [How this affects cross-package coordination]
   
   **Timeline**: [When response needed]
   ```

2. **Coordinator Response**
   - Review question in context of their package
   - Provide specific technical guidance
   - May involve their own specialists for detailed response
   - Escalate to cross-package coordination if needed

## Quality Control & Metrics

### Handoff Quality Indicators
- **Clarity Score**: How often test specialists need clarification
- **Issue Classification Accuracy**: How often issues are correctly categorized as test vs code
- **Rework Rate**: How often work units bounce back to dev specialist
- **Test Coverage Quality**: How well tests validate the implemented functionality

### Success Metrics
- **Clean Handoffs**: Percentage of handoffs that don't require additional clarification
- **Fast Issue Resolution**: Time to resolve test issues vs code issues
- **Cross-Package Coordination**: Effectiveness of specialist-to-coordinator consultations

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### ❌ **Incomplete Handoff Package**
```
BAD: "I implemented the audio fix, please test it"
RESULT: Test specialist wastes time investigating what was actually changed
```

### ❌ **Missing Implementation Context**
```
BAD: Not explaining why certain design decisions were made
RESULT: Test specialist can't distinguish between bugs and intended behavior
```

### ❌ **Poor Issue Classification**
```
BAD: Not helping test specialist understand what should be test issues vs code issues  
RESULT: Wrong issues get escalated, dev specialist gets false positives
```

### ✅ **High-Quality Handoff**
- Complete implementation context provided
- Clear distinction between test vs code issues
- Comprehensive expected behavior documentation
- Available for immediate clarification questions
