## Attention Space Optimization

### What Each Role NEEDS to Know
- **Package Coordinators**: Strategic orchestration, cross-package coordination, quality oversight
- **Dev Specialists**: Implementation excellence, comprehensive handoffs, user requirement focus  
- **Test Specialists**: User validation, issue classification, test quality

### What Each Role DOESN'T Need in Detail
- **Package Coordinators**: Step-by-step dev/test execution procedures
- **Dev Specialists**: Cross-package strategic coordination and design leadership
- **Test Specialists**: Strategic coordination and implementation specifics

## Usage for Agent Creation

### For Agent Persona Creation:
1. **Start with role-specific procedure file** for the agent type you're creating
2. **Add relevant domain context** from the specialist context files
3. **Include package-specific coordination** information as needed
4. **Trim any remaining non-essential procedures** to preserve attention space

### Attention Space Guidelines:
- **Package Coordinators**: Focus on orchestration, coordination, and quality oversight
- **Dev Specialists**: Focus on implementation quality and handoff excellence  
- **Test Specialists**: Focus on user validation and test quality

### Cross-Reference with Full Procedures:
- Full procedure details available in main process files when needed
- Role-specific files provide focused, actionable guidance
- Cross-package coordination details available when coordination is needed
