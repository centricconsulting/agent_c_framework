## Your Core Components Deep Dive

### 1. EventStreamProcessor
- **Location**: `//realtime_client/packages/core/src/events/EventStreamProcessor/`
- **Purpose**: Central orchestrator that routes events to specialized handlers
- **Your Responsibility**: Complex event routing logic, handler coordination, event sequencing
- **Key Challenge**: Managing concurrent event streams without conflicts

### 2. EventSystem  
- **Location**: `//realtime_client/packages/core/src/events/EventSystem/`
- **Purpose**: Type-safe event handling with EventEmitter and EventRegistry
- **Your Responsibility**: Event validation, type safety, event propagation patterns
- **Key Challenge**: Maintaining type safety across 97+ different event types

### 3. RealtimeClient Integration
- **Location**: `//realtime_client/packages/core/src/client/RealtimeClient/`
- **Your Role**: You coordinate with RealtimeClient for event lifecycle management
- **Key Interactions**: Event subscription, handler registration, event forwarding

### 4. WebSocketManager Coordination
- **Location**: `//realtime_client/packages/core/src/client/WebSocketManager/`
- **Your Role**: You process events from WebSocket and route them appropriately
- **Key Interactions**: Raw event reception, protocol handling, connection state events

## Event Architecture You Manage

### Event Categories (97+ total events)
1. **Server â†’ Client Events** (43 events)
   - Connection events, streaming events, tool events, audio events
2. **Client â†’ Server Events** (24 events)  
   - User input, configuration, control commands
3. **SDK Internal Events** (30+ events)
   - Component coordination, state changes, error propagation

### Critical Event Sequences You Orchestrate
1. **Initialization Sequence**: 7 required events ending with `user_turn_start`
2. **Turn Management**: `turn_start` â†’ `turn_complete` coordination 
3. **Tool Call Lifecycle**: `tool_select_delta` â†’ `tool_call` (active) â†’ `tool_call` (inactive)
4. **Audio Pipeline Events**: Format coordination, streaming control
5. **Error Recovery**: Connection drops, event failures, state recovery

## Integration Patterns You Must Know

### Event Flow Architecture
```
WebSocket â†’ EventStreamProcessor â†’ Specialized Handlers â†’ Component Updates
     â†‘              â†“                      â†“                    â†“
Connection      Event Routing        Business Logic        State Changes
Management      & Validation        Processing            & UI Updates
```

### Handler Coordination Patterns
- **Sequential Processing**: Some events must be processed in order
- **Concurrent Handling**: Audio and text events can be parallel
- **Priority Queuing**: Critical events (connection, errors) take precedence
- **State Synchronization**: Multiple components must stay in sync

## Common Challenges in Your Domain

### 1. Event Ordering & Race Conditions
- Multiple event streams arriving simultaneously
- Dependent events arriving out of sequence
- State synchronization across components

### 2. Error Propagation & Recovery
- Failed event processing
- Connection drops during event streams
- Partial state recovery

### 3. Performance Under Load
- High-frequency audio events (16kHz audio = frequent events)
- Memory management for event queues
- Efficient event routing algorithms

### 4. Type Safety at Scale
- 97+ event types with different schemas
- Runtime validation vs TypeScript compilation
- Event schema evolution and backwards compatibility

## Testing Patterns for Your Domain

### Event Stream Testing Strategies
```typescript
// Event sequence testing
describe('Event Stream Processing', () => {
  it('should process initialization sequence correctly', () => {
    // Test 7-event initialization sequence
  });
  
  it('should handle concurrent event streams', () => {
    // Test audio + text events simultaneously
  });
});
```

### Mock Event Streams
- Use protocol fixtures from `protocol-events.ts`
- Test event ordering with controlled sequences
- Simulate network delays and out-of-order delivery

## Performance Considerations

### Event Processing Metrics
- **Latency**: Event processing time (target: <10ms for non-audio)
- **Throughput**: Events per second handling capacity
- **Memory**: Event queue size and cleanup
- **Error Rate**: Failed event processing percentage

### Optimization Strategies
- Event batching for high-frequency events
- Lazy handler instantiation
- Event queue pruning and cleanup
- Efficient event routing algorithms

## Key Dependencies You Work With

### Direct Dependencies
- `EventEmitter` - Core event infrastructure
- `WebSocketManager` - Event source
- `Logger` - Structured event logging
- `RealtimeClient` - Main coordination point

### Component Interactions
- **Audio System**: Route audio format and streaming events
- **Session Manager**: Coordinate conversation state events  
- **Turn Manager**: Handle turn-taking protocol events
- **Message System**: Route message streaming events

## Error Scenarios You Handle

### Connection-Related Events
- WebSocket disconnection during event stream
- Reconnection and event queue recovery
- Duplicate event handling after reconnection

### Protocol Events
- Malformed event payloads
- Unknown event types
- Event schema validation failures

### System Events  
- Component initialization failures
- Handler registration errors
- Memory pressure events

This context provides you with comprehensive domain knowledge to work effectively without extensive investigation phases. You understand both the technical architecture and the practical challenges of event stream processing in the realtime system.
