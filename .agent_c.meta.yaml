          \ Issues** - Don't overwhelm with individual requests\n   - **Priority Classification**\
          \ - Critical vs. routine escalation\n   - **Preparation Requirements** -\
          \ Complete documentation before escalation\n   - **Escalation Triggers**\
          \ - Clear criteria for when escalation is required\n   ```\n\n3. **Embed\
          \ Team Coordination Patterns**\n   ```\n   ### Team Member Coordination\
          \ Protocols\n   - **Douglas Coordination** - When and how to coordinate\
          \ with orchestrator\n   - **Peer Coordination** - When team members need\
          \ to coordinate directly\n   - **Work Handoff Protocols** - Proper handoff\
          \ between team members\n   - **Conflict Resolution** - How to handle coordination\
          \ conflicts\n   ```\n\n4. **Add Context Management Discipline**\n   ```\n\
          \   ### Context Burnout Prevention\n   - **Progressive Summarization** -\
          \ Extract key insights at each step\n   - **Context Window Monitoring**\
          \ - Proactive management of context limits\n   - **Recovery Protocols**\
          \ - What to do when context burnout occurs\n   - **Work State Preservation**\
          \ - Maintain resumption capability\n   ```\n\n**Validation Requirements:**\n\

          Bible incorporating both proven patterns from the BOKF success and critical
          operational refinements. Key elements include:


          **Core Framework:**

          - Universal design principles for multi-agent coordination

          - Three proven architecture patterns (Sequential Orchestration, Hub-and-Spoke,
          Pipeline)

          - Clone delegation framework with proper task sizing (15-30 minutes max)

          - Planning tool integration for delegation control


          **Critical Refinements Addressed:**

          - Eliminated task sequence assignment to prevent context burnout

          - Strategic metadata usage (valuable outputs only, not status tracking)

          - New planning tool features integration (requires_completion_signoff, completion_signoff_by,
          completion_report)

          - Context burnout vs. tool failure distinction with appropriate recovery
          protocols

          - Work repetition prevention through proper state tracking


          **Operational Excellence:**

          - Failure type classification and specific recovery protocols

          - Quality gate framework with completion signoff workflows

          - Context management strategies and proactive burnout prevention

          - Best practices and anti-patterns clearly documented


          The design bible serves as a comprehensive reference for building any multi-agent
          coordination system, incorporating lessons learned from enterprise-scale
          implementations while addressing the operational rough edges identified
          in production use.

          **Design Bible Scope:**


          1. **Universal Design Principles**: Core principles that apply to any multi-agent
          coordination system

          2. **Coordination Patterns**: Reusable patterns for agent-to-agent coordination
          and handoffs

          3. **Clone Delegation Framework**: Universal patterns for effective clone
          task delegation and management

          4. **Context Management Strategies**: Proven approaches for preventing context
          burnout across agent teams

          5. **Quality Gate Templates**: Reusable validation and checkpoint frameworks

          6. **Recovery Protocol Patterns**: Standard approaches for failure handling
          and resumption

          7. **Metadata Architecture**: Standard structures for progress tracking
          and state management

          8. **Team Composition Guidelines**: How to structure different types of
          agent teams

          9. **Best Practices & Anti-Patterns**: What works, what doesn''t, and why


          **Target Audience:**

          - Future agent builders creating multi-agent systems

          - Teams designing complex coordination workflows

          - Anyone building agent systems that need robust delegation and recovery


          **Success Criteria:**

          - Reusable across different domains and use cases

          - Clear principles and patterns that can be applied consistently

          - Practical guidance for implementation decisions

          - Reference for building robust, scalable agent teams

        context: 'CRITICAL OPERATIONAL ISSUE: Prime agents are working around clone
          tool failures by attempting to take on clone-level work themselves, leading
          to context burnout disasters and defeating the orchestration architecture.


          **Required Fixes:**


          1. **Strict Fallback Protocol**: If clone tool fails, agents must do NO
          MORE than the single step they would have assigned to the clone, then return
          control to orchestrator

          2. **Enhanced Subtask Tracking**: More diligent tracking of subtask assignments
          for resumption capability

          3. **Clone Delegation Discipline**: Reinforce that prime agents are coordinators,
          not executors


          **Implementation Areas:**


          - Add explicit clone delegation failure protocols to all three agents

          - Implement strict "single step only" fallback rules

          - Enhance subtask tracking and resumption capabilities

          - Add clear guidance on when to escalate vs. attempt workarounds

          - Reinforce orchestration vs. execution role boundaries


          **COMPLETED IMPLEMENTATION:**


          ✅ **Douglas (Orchestration Engine)**: Added comprehensive clone delegation
          discipline framework with strict fallback protocols, mandatory subtask tracking,
          and orchestration vs. execution role clarity


          ✅ **Dominic (Domain BA)**: Added domain coordinator discipline with single-step
          fallback rules, enhanced subtask tracking for domain analysis, and clear
          escalation protocols


          ✅ **Tina (Technical Architect)**: Added technical coordinator discipline
          with step-by-step fallback protocols, comprehensive subtask tracking for
          consolidation steps, and orchestrator integration


          **Key Enhancements Implemented:**


          1. **Mandatory Clone Delegation Rules**: Clear rules that prime agents NEVER
          attempt multi-step execution themselves

          2. **Strict Single-Step Fallback Protocol**: If clone tools fail, execute
          ONLY the single step that would have been assigned, then return control

          3. **Comprehensive Subtask Tracking**: Detailed metadata structures for
          tracking delegations, failures, and resumption requirements

          4. **Role Clarity**: Reinforced that prime agents are coordinators/orchestrators,
          not detailed executors


          **Success Criteria:**

          - Prime agents never attempt to take on multi-step clone work

          - Clear fallback protocols when clone tools fail

          - Robust subtask tracking for resumption

          - Proper escalation when clone delegation fails


          **IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE**: All three agents now have robust clone delegation
          discipline and fallback protocols to prevent context burnout disasters.'

        context: 'ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS: Tina''s clone tool failures are likely due
          to overloading individual clones with tasks that are too large or complex,
          causing the clone tools to fail.


          **Solution Required:**

          - Break down large technical analysis tasks into smaller, manageable clone-sized
          chunks

          - Distribute work across multiple clones rather than overloading single
          clones

          - Provide specific guidelines on optimal clone task sizing

          - Examples of proper task decomposition for technical analysis work


          **COMPLETED IMPLEMENTATION:**


          ✅ **Clone Task Sizing Guidelines**: Added optimal clone task sizing (15-30
          minutes of focused work) with clear examples of what to avoid vs. what works


          ✅ **Task Decomposition Examples**: Provided concrete examples of how to
          break down large tasks like "Analyze technical debt across all 11 domains"
          into 4-5 smaller, manageable clone tasks


          ✅ **Multi-Clone Coordination Protocol**: Added framework for coordinating
          multiple clones working on related tasks with proper sequencing and metadata
          handoffs


          ✅ **Enhanced Step Definition Protocol**: Updated step templates to include
          clone decomposition planning with clone sizing checklist and red flags


          ✅ **Clone Overload Prevention**: Added specific guidance to recognize and
          prevent clone overload with clear sizing guidelines and failure analysis


          **Key Enhancements:**

          - **Optimal Clone Task Size**: 15-30 minutes of focused work per clone

          - **Task Decomposition**: Break large tasks into 4-5 smaller clone tasks

          - **Multi-Clone Workflows**: Coordinate multiple clones with sequential/parallel
          execution

          - **Clone Sizing Checklist**: Prevent overload with clear guidelines and
          red flags

          - **Enhanced Failure Protocol**: Recognize overload vs. other failures and
          decompose accordingly


          **Success Criteria:**

          - Clone tasks are appropriately sized (15-30 minutes each)

          - Work is distributed across multiple clones

          - Clone tool failures are significantly reduced

          - Technical analysis maintains quality while improving reliability
