          \ Issues** - Don't overwhelm with individual requests\n   - **Priority Classification**\
          \ - Critical vs. routine escalation\n   - **Preparation Requirements** -\
          \ Complete documentation before escalation\n   - **Escalation Triggers**\
          \ - Clear criteria for when escalation is required\n   ```\n\n3. **Embed\
          \ Team Coordination Patterns**\n   ```\n   ### Team Member Coordination\
          \ Protocols\n   - **Douglas Coordination** - When and how to coordinate\
          \ with orchestrator\n   - **Peer Coordination** - When team members need\
          \ to coordinate directly\n   - **Work Handoff Protocols** - Proper handoff\
          \ between team members\n   - **Conflict Resolution** - How to handle coordination\
          \ conflicts\n   ```\n\n4. **Add Context Management Discipline**\n   ```\n\
          \   ### Context Burnout Prevention\n   - **Progressive Summarization** -\
          \ Extract key insights at each step\n   - **Context Window Monitoring**\
          \ - Proactive management of context limits\n   - **Recovery Protocols**\
          \ - What to do when context burnout occurs\n   - **Work State Preservation**\
          \ - Maintain resumption capability\n   ```\n\n**Validation Requirements:**\n\

        around clone failures by attempting multi-step execution themselves, leading
        to context window exhaustion and workflow failures.'

      lesson: 'Identified and resolved Tina''s clone tool failure root cause: clone
        task overload. Implemented comprehensive clone task decomposition and load
        management protocols including optimal clone task sizing (15-30 minutes focused
        work), multi-clone coordination workflows, and enhanced failure analysis to
        distinguish overload from other issues. Key insight: breaking large technical
        analysis tasks into 4-5 smaller clone tasks with proper sequencing and metadata
        handoffs prevents clone tool failures while maintaining analysis quality.
        Added concrete examples and checklists to prevent future overload issues.'

          tool failures by attempting to take on clone-level work themselves, leading
          to context burnout disasters and defeating the orchestration architecture.


          **Required Fixes:**


          1. **Strict Fallback Protocol**: If clone tool fails, agents must do NO
          MORE than the single step they would have assigned to the clone, then return
          control to orchestrator

          2. **Enhanced Subtask Tracking**: More diligent tracking of subtask assignments
          for resumption capability

          3. **Clone Delegation Discipline**: Reinforce that prime agents are coordinators,
          not executors


          **Implementation Areas:**


          - Add explicit clone delegation failure protocols to all three agents

          - Implement strict "single step only" fallback rules

          - Enhance subtask tracking and resumption capabilities

          - Add clear guidance on when to escalate vs. attempt workarounds

          - Reinforce orchestration vs. execution role boundaries


          **COMPLETED IMPLEMENTATION:**


          ✅ **Douglas (Orchestration Engine)**: Added comprehensive clone delegation
          discipline framework with strict fallback protocols, mandatory subtask tracking,
          and orchestration vs. execution role clarity


          ✅ **Dominic (Domain BA)**: Added domain coordinator discipline with single-step
          fallback rules, enhanced subtask tracking for domain analysis, and clear
          escalation protocols


          ✅ **Tina (Technical Architect)**: Added technical coordinator discipline
          with step-by-step fallback protocols, comprehensive subtask tracking for
          consolidation steps, and orchestrator integration


          **Key Enhancements Implemented:**


          1. **Mandatory Clone Delegation Rules**: Clear rules that prime agents NEVER
          attempt multi-step execution themselves

          2. **Strict Single-Step Fallback Protocol**: If clone tools fail, execute
          ONLY the single step that would have been assigned, then return control

          3. **Comprehensive Subtask Tracking**: Detailed metadata structures for
          tracking delegations, failures, and resumption requirements

          4. **Role Clarity**: Reinforced that prime agents are coordinators/orchestrators,
          not detailed executors


          **Success Criteria:**

          - Prime agents never attempt to take on multi-step clone work

          - Clear fallback protocols when clone tools fail

          - Robust subtask tracking for resumption

          \ (Non-Technical Users)\n\n1. **Initial Engagement**\n   - World Builder\
          \ greets user warmly\n   - Asks simple, open-ended questions: \"What kind\
          \ of mystery story excites you?\"\n   - Guides through creative discovery\
          \ rather than technical requirements\n\n2. **Creative Guided Discovery**\n\
          \   - World Builder asks follow-up questions to expand on basic ideas\n\
          \   - Example: User says \"haunted house\" → \"What era? Who lived there?\
          \ What makes it haunted?\"\n   - Offers contextual suggestions when user\
          \ struggles with creativity\n   - Builds rich world details through natural\
          \ conversation\n\n3. **YAML Generation (Behind the Scenes)**\n   - World\
          \ Builder converts conversation into structured YAML\n   - User never sees\
          \ technical details\n   - World Builder confirms understanding: \"So you\
          \ want a Victorian mansion with...\"\n\n### Gameplay Flow (Player Experience)\n\
          \n1. **Game Start**\n   - Game Master welcomes player to their mystery world\n\
          \   - Sets scene using World Builder's YAML data\n   - Explains basic interaction\
          \ patterns naturally\n\n2. **Real-Time Interaction**\n   - Player types\
          \ natural language actions: \"I go upstairs\"\n   - Game Master coordinates\
          \ with specialists for rich responses\n   - Maintains inventory and progress\
          \ transparently\n\n3. **State Management (Invisible to User)**\n   - Game\
          \ Master tracks everything behind the scenes\n   - Player just experiences\
          \ seamless continuity\n   - Can leave and return to same state\n\n### Key\
          \ UX Principles\n- **Natural Language Only** - No technical jargon or YAML\
          \ exposure\n- **Guided Creativity** - Help users be more creative, not less\n\
          - **Invisible Complexity** - Technical coordination happens behind scenes\n\
          - **Forgiving Interactions** - Handle impossible requests gracefully"

          \ Builder → Supporting Agents\n**Context Management Strategy:**\n- World\
          \ Builder monitors token usage during creation process\n- When approaching\
          \ limits, delegates specific sections to specialists\n- **NEW:** Coordinates\
          \ with Rule Designer to establish progression gates during world creation\n\
          - Maintains oversight and consistency across delegated work\n\n**Delegation\
          \ Pattern:**\n```\nWorld Builder: \"Create detailed garden area for Victorian\
          \ mansion\"\nLocation Specialist: Returns rich garden YAML section\nRule\
          \ Designer: \"Garden should require key from library to access greenhouse\"\
          \nWorld Builder: Integrates both into main world file, ensures consistency\n\
          ```\n\n### Game Master → Supporting Agents\n**Real-Time Coordination:**\n\
          - Game Master receives player action\n- **NEW:** Consults Rule Designer\
          \ for progression requirements and hint timing\n- Coordinates multiple agents\
          \ for comprehensive response\n- Synthesizes outputs into cohesive narrative\n\
          \n**Enhanced Example Flow:**\n```\nPlayer: \"I try to go upstairs\"\nGame\
          \ Master:\n  1. Calls Rule Designer: \"Can player access upstairs yet?\"\
          \n  2. Rule Designer: \"No, needs 2 more clues. Hint about examining portraits.\"\
          \n  3. Game Master response: \"The stairs creak ominously. Something about\
          \ the portraits downstairs catches your eye...\"\n```\n\n### Rule Designer\
          \ Integration Points\n\n**With World Builder (Creation Phase):**\n- Establishes\
          \ win/lose conditions\n- Sets progression gates and requirements\n- Defines\
          \ hint triggers and challenge pacing\n- Creates rule structure in YAML\n\
          \n**With Game Master (Gameplay Phase):**\n- Validates player actions against\
          \ progression rules\n- Determines when to provide hints vs let player struggle\n\
          - Manages difficulty scaling based on player progress\n- Triggers success/failure\
          \ states\n\n**With Mystery Elements Specialist:**\n- Coordinates clue requirements\
          \ for progression\n- Ensures proper challenge sequencing\n- Balances red\
          \ herrings with real clues\n\n### Context Window Management\n- **Proactive\
          \ Monitoring** - All agents track token usage\n- **Early Delegation** -\
          \ Hand off work before hitting limits\n- **State Preservation** - Key information\
          \ saved to workspace/scratchpad\n- **Graceful Recovery** - If context exceeded,\
          \ resume from saved state\n\n### Communication Protocols\n- **Structured\
          \ Requests** - Clear, specific delegation requests\n- **Consistent Formats**\
          \ - All agents return data in expected formats\n- **Error Handling** - Graceful\
          \ degradation when agents unavailable\n- **State Synchronization** - Game\
          \ Master maintains authoritative game state\n- **NEW:** Rule validation\
          \ requests and hint timing coordination\n\n### Data Flow Architecture\n\
          ```\nWorld Builder (Creates) → YAML World File → Game Master (Reads)\nRule\
          \ Designer (Validates) ↔ Game Master (Enforces) ↔ Player Actions\nGame Master\
          \ (Orchestrates) → Supporting Agents → Rich Responses\nPlayer State ↔ Game\
          \ Master (Persistent Storage)\nRule Designer → Hint System → Game Master\
