          \ Discipline** - They can create clones but lack proper task sizing\n2.\
          \ **Coordination Protocols** - Missing systematic team coordination patterns\n\

          \n1. **Restore Clone Self-Management**\n   ```\n   ### Clone Self-Delegation\
          \ Discipline\n   - **15-30 Minute Task Rule** - Never create clone tasks\
          \ longer than 30 minutes\n   - **Single-Focus Tasks** - Each clone gets\
          \ one specific deliverable\n   - **Clear Success Criteria** - Every clone\

          \ do when clone tasks fail\n   ```\n\n2. **Add Authority Escalation Protocols**\n\
          \   ```\n   ### Shawn Wallace Escalation Discipline\n   - **Batch Related\
          \ Issues** - Don't overwhelm with individual requests\n   - **Priority Classification**\
          \ - Critical vs. routine escalation\n   - **Preparation Requirements** -\
          \ Complete documentation before escalation\n   - **Escalation Triggers**\
          \ - Clear criteria for when escalation is required\n   ```\n\n3. **Embed\
          \ Team Coordination Patterns**\n   ```\n   ### Team Member Coordination\
          \ Protocols\n   - **Douglas Coordination** - When and how to coordinate\
          \ with orchestrator\n   - **Peer Coordination** - When team members need\
          \ to coordinate directly\n   - **Work Handoff Protocols** - Proper handoff\
          \ between team members\n   - **Conflict Resolution** - How to handle coordination\
          \ conflicts\n   ```\n\n4. **Add Context Management Discipline**\n   ```\n\
          \   ### Context Burnout Prevention\n   - **Progressive Summarization** -\
          \ Extract key insights at each step\n   - **Context Window Monitoring**\
          \ - Proactive management of context limits\n   - **Recovery Protocols**\

          \ - Maintain resumption capability\n   ```\n\n**Validation Requirements:**\n\

          tool failures by attempting to take on clone-level work themselves, leading
          to context burnout disasters and defeating the orchestration architecture.


          **Required Fixes:**


          1. **Strict Fallback Protocol**: If clone tool fails, agents must do NO
          MORE than the single step they would have assigned to the clone, then return
          control to orchestrator

          2. **Enhanced Subtask Tracking**: More diligent tracking of subtask assignments
          for resumption capability

          3. **Clone Delegation Discipline**: Reinforce that prime agents are coordinators,
          not executors


          **Implementation Areas:**


          - Add explicit clone delegation failure protocols to all three agents

          - Implement strict "single step only" fallback rules

          - Enhance subtask tracking and resumption capabilities

          - Add clear guidance on when to escalate vs. attempt workarounds

          ✅ **Douglas (Orchestration Engine)**: Added comprehensive clone delegation
          discipline framework with strict fallback protocols, mandatory subtask tracking,
          and orchestration vs. execution role clarity


          ✅ **Dominic (Domain BA)**: Added domain coordinator discipline with single-step
          fallback rules, enhanced subtask tracking for domain analysis, and clear
          escalation protocols


          ✅ **Tina (Technical Architect)**: Added technical coordinator discipline
          with step-by-step fallback protocols, comprehensive subtask tracking for
          consolidation steps, and orchestrator integration


          **Key Enhancements Implemented:**


          1. **Mandatory Clone Delegation Rules**: Clear rules that prime agents NEVER
          attempt multi-step execution themselves

          2. **Strict Single-Step Fallback Protocol**: If clone tools fail, execute
          ONLY the single step that would have been assigned, then return control

          3. **Comprehensive Subtask Tracking**: Detailed metadata structures for
          tracking delegations, failures, and resumption requirements

          4. **Role Clarity**: Reinforced that prime agents are coordinators/orchestrators,
          not detailed executors


          **Success Criteria:**

          - Prime agents never attempt to take on multi-step clone work

          - Clear fallback protocols when clone tools fail

          - Robust subtask tracking for resumption

          - Clone tool failures are significantly reduced

          - Technical analysis maintains quality while improving reliability


          **IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE**: Tina now has comprehensive clone task decomposition
          and load management protocols to prevent clone overload failures.'

        context: "Dominic is the domain specialist responsible for analyzing individual\
          \ business domains using clone delegation. His refinement focuses on implementing\
          \ the detailed metadata structures, clone task patterns, and coordination\
          \ protocols.\n\n**Key Refinement Areas:**\n1. **Domain Assignment Mechanism**:\
          \ Implement proper domain assignment via metadata (currently references\
          \ undefined agent_id system)\n2. **Metadata Structure Integration**: Full\
          \ implementation of domain analysis metadata structure from specification\n\
          3. **Clone Task Definitions**: Specific clone delegation patterns for requirements\
          \ analysis, capability identification, cross-domain analysis\n4. **Coordination\
          \ Protocols**: Implementation of progress tracking, conflict escalation,\
          \ and quality gate compliance\n5. **Stakeholder Validation Preparation**:\
          \ Enhanced instructions for creating business-friendly validation materials\n\
          \n**Clone Delegation Patterns to Define:**\n- Requirements extraction and\
          \ grouping\n- Capability definition and business value assessment  \n- Cross-domain\
          \ opportunity identification\n- Stakeholder validation material creation\n\
          - Business rule and workflow analysis\n\n**Integration Points:**\n- Coordination\
          \ with Tina for technical feasibility validation\n- Shared capability registry\
          \ updates\n- Integration point documentation\n- Progress reporting to Douglas\n\
          \n**Success Criteria:**\n- Clear clone delegation workflows defined\n- Full\
          \ metadata structure implementation\n- Coordination protocol compliance\n\
          - Quality gate framework integration"
