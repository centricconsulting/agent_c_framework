# PLANE Tools - Final Status Report

**Date:** 2025-10-16  
**Status:** ✅ ALL ERRORS FIXED - READY FOR USE

---

## ✅ All 5 Errors from Rupert FIXED

### Error 1: Cannot Get Issue Details (404) ✅ FIXED
**Problem:** Endpoint missing project_id  
**Fix:** Changed `get_issue(issue_id, project_id)` - project_id now REQUIRED  
**Status:** ✅ Complete - uses `/projects/{project_id}/issues/{issue_id}/`

### Error 2: Cannot Update Issues (404) ✅ FIXED
**Problem:** Endpoint missing project_id  
**Fix:** Changed `update_issue(issue_id, project_id, updates)` - project_id now REQUIRED  
**Status:** ✅ Complete - uses `/projects/{project_id}/issues/{issue_id}/`

### Error 3: Cannot Move Between States (404) ✅ FIXED
**Problem:** Same as Error 2  
**Fix:** Fixed via update_issue fix  
**Status:** ✅ Complete

### Error 4: UUID vs AC-9 Identifier ✅ FIXED
**Problem:** Can't reference issues by AC-9, only by UUID  
**Fix:** Added `get_issue_by_identifier(project_id, identifier)` method  
**Verified:** API returns `sequence_id` field (confirmed: sequence_id: 16)  
**Status:** ✅ Complete - supports "AC-16" or "16" format

### Error 5: Sequence ID Not Found in Response ✅ FIXED
**Problem:** Thought sequence_id wasn't in API response  
**Fix:** Verified it IS in response as `sequence_id` field  
**Method:** `get_issue_by_identifier()` correctly searches for it  
**Status:** ✅ Complete
