# PLANE Tools Fix Progress

## Status: IN PROGRESS

### ‚úÖ Completed
1. Identified root cause: Synchronous code in async framework
2. Studied health tools (PubMed) for correct async pattern
3. Fixed import error in agent_c_tools/__init__.py
4. Documented all error patterns from user
5. Created comprehensive fix plan

### üöß Next Steps
1. Convert PlaneSession to use aiohttp (like PubMed)
2. Convert PlaneClient methods to async
3. Update toolsets to await client calls
4. Test each component in isolation
5. Comprehensive integration test
6. Only then enable imports

### üìã Pattern to Follow (from PubMed)
- Use `aiohttp.ClientSession()` for HTTP
- All HTTP methods are `async with session.get()...`
- All tool methods are `async def`
- Proper error handling with try/except
- Return strings from tools

### ‚è±Ô∏è Estimated Time
- PlaneSession conversion: 30 min
- PlaneClient conversion: 30 min
- Toolset updates: 30 min
- Testing: 30 min
- **Total:** 2 hours

## Current State
- Server CAN start (imports commented out)
- PLANE tools NOT available
- Working on async conversion
