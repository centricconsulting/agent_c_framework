# PLANE Tools - Phase 4 (Advanced Features)

**Status:** 📋 Planned (Not Started)  
**Focus:** Nice-to-have features for advanced use cases

---

## 🎯 Phase 4 Features

Phase 4 includes **"nice-to-have" advanced features** that aren't essential but add convenience for specific workflows.

---

## 1. Time Tracking ⏱️

### What It Does
Track time spent on issues for billing, reporting, or capacity planning.

### Tools That Would Be Added
- `plane_log_time(issue_id, hours, description, date)` - Log time spent
- `plane_get_time_logs(issue_id)` - View time logs for an issue
- `plane_get_time_summary(project_id, user_id, start_date, end_date)` - Time reports
- `plane_update_estimate(issue_id, estimated_hours)` - Set time estimates
- `plane_get_estimate_vs_actual(issue_id)` - Compare estimate to actual

### Use Cases
```
User: "Log 3 hours on issue AC-25 for API development"
Rupert: ✅ Logged 3 hours on AC-25

User: "How much time have I spent on project AC this week?"
Rupert: You've logged 18.5 hours on Agent_C project this week:
  - AC-25: 8 hours (API development)
  - AC-30: 6.5 hours (Bug fixes)
  - AC-35: 4 hours (Documentation)

User: "Are we on track with our estimates?"
Rupert: Project AC time tracking:
  - Estimated: 120 hours total
  - Actual: 95 hours (79%)
  - Remaining work: ~40 estimated hours
  - Status: Slightly under estimate
```

### When You'd Want This
- ✅ **Billable projects** - Track client hours
- ✅ **Capacity planning** - Understand team velocity
- ✅ **Budget tracking** - Monitor hours vs budget
- ✅ **Estimate accuracy** - Improve future estimates

### When You Wouldn't
- ❌ **Internal projects** - No billing needed
- ❌ **Agile without time tracking** - Story points instead
- ❌ **Small team** - Overhead not worth it

**Effort to build:** ~2-3 hours  
**Complexity:** Medium (time calculations, date ranges)  
**Value if you need it:** High  
**Value if you don't:** Zero

## 2. File Attachments 📎

### What It Does
Upload and manage files attached to issues (screenshots, logs, designs, etc.)

### Tools That Would Be Added
- `plane_upload_attachment(issue_id, file_path, description)` - Upload file
- `plane_list_attachments(issue_id)` - List issue attachments
- `plane_download_attachment(attachment_id, save_path)` - Download file
- `plane_delete_attachment(attachment_id)` - Remove attachment
- `plane_get_attachment_url(attachment_id)` - Get public URL

### Use Cases
```
User: "Attach error.log to issue AC-40"
Rupert: ✅ Uploaded error.log (2.3 MB) to AC-40

User: "Show me attachments on AC-40"
Rupert: Issue AC-40 has 3 attachments:
  - error.log (2.3 MB, added today)
  - screenshot.png (450 KB, added yesterday)
  - design.pdf (1.2 MB, added 3 days ago)

User: "Download the screenshot"
Rupert: ✅ Downloaded screenshot.png to /downloads/
```

### When You'd Want This
- ✅ **Bug reports** - Attach screenshots/logs
- ✅ **Design work** - Share mockups/assets
- ✅ **Documentation** - Attach specs/diagrams
- ✅ **Evidence/artifacts** - Test results, reports

### When You Wouldn't
- ❌ **Use external storage** - Google Drive, Dropbox links work fine
- ❌ **Small attachments** - Can paste images in comments
- ❌ **Code issues** - Link to GitHub instead

**Effort to build:** ~2-3 hours  
**Complexity:** Medium (file handling, storage, MIME types)  
**Alternative:** Just paste links to external files in issue descriptions

---

## 3. Custom Fields 🔧

### What It Does
Add project-specific custom fields to issues (e.g., "Customer Name", "Version", "Environment")

### Tools That Would Be Added
- `plane_list_custom_fields(project_id)` - List available custom fields
- `plane_create_custom_field(project_id, name, type)` - Create custom field
- `plane_set_custom_field(issue_id, field_id, value)` - Set field value on issue
- `plane_get_custom_field_values(issue_id)` - Get all custom field values

### Use Cases
```
User: "Create a custom field 'Customer' for project AC"
Rupert: ✅ Created custom field 'Customer' (type: text)

User: "Set customer to 'Acme Corp' on issue AC-50"
Rupert: ✅ Set Customer = 'Acme Corp' on AC-50

User: "Show me all issues for customer 'Acme Corp'"
Rupert: Found 5 issues for Acme Corp:
  - AC-50: Login bug
  - AC-51: Payment integration
  ...
```

### When You'd Want This
- ✅ **Client work** - Track which client each issue is for
- ✅ **Multi-environment** - Track dev/staging/prod
- ✅ **Custom workflow** - Track approval stages, cost centers, etc.
- ✅ **Reporting** - Group issues by custom dimensions

### When You Wouldn't
- ❌ **Labels work fine** - Can use labels instead of custom fields
- ❌ **Simple projects** - Standard fields (priority, state) sufficient
- ❌ **Low customization needs** - Out-of-box fields are enough

**Effort to build:** ~1-2 hours  
**Complexity:** Low (basic CRUD)  
**Alternative:** Use labels or issue descriptions for custom data

---

## 4. Advanced Reporting & Exports 📊

### What It Does
Generate reports and export data in various formats

### Tools That Would Be Added
- `plane_export_issues_csv(project_id, filters)` - Export to CSV
- `plane_export_project_report_pdf(project_id)` - PDF report
- `plane_generate_burndown_chart(cycle_id)` - Visual burndown
- `plane_generate_velocity_report(project_id, sprints)` - Velocity trends
- `plane_export_time_report(project_id, start_date, end_date)` - Time tracking export

### Use Cases
```
User: "Export all bugs to CSV for analysis"
Rupert: ✅ Exported 45 bugs to bugs_report.csv

User: "Create a project status report for stakeholders"
Rupert: ✅ Generated project_status.pdf with:
  - Progress overview
  - Issue breakdown
  - Team workload
  - Timeline forecast

User: "Show me burndown for current sprint"
Rupert: [Generates chart showing ideal vs actual burndown]
```

### When You'd Want This
- ✅ **Executive reporting** - Share with non-PLANE users
- ✅ **Data analysis** - Import to Excel/BI tools
- ✅ **Archiving** - Export for records
- ✅ **Presentations** - Charts and graphs

### When You Wouldn't
- ❌ **PLANE UI sufficient** - Built-in reports work fine
- ❌ **Small projects** - Can just look at PLANE directly
- ❌ **No external reporting** - Team uses PLANE for everything

**Effort to build:** ~3-4 hours  
**Complexity:** Medium-High (charts, PDF generation, formatting)  
**Alternative:** Use PLANE's built-in exports

## 🤔 Do YOU Need Phase 4?

Ask yourself:

### Time Tracking
- Do you bill clients or track hours? **YES → Build it** / **NO → Skip it**
- Do you need estimate vs actual analysis? **YES → Build it** / **NO → Skip it**

### File Attachments
- Do you attach many files to issues? **YES → Build it** / **NO → Use links**
- Are external storage links inconvenient? **YES → Build it** / **NO → Skip it**

### Custom Fields
- Do you need to track data PLANE doesn't have fields for? **YES → Build it** / **NO → Use labels**
- Do labels/descriptions not meet your needs? **YES → Build it** / **NO → Skip it**

### Advanced Reports
- Do you need to share reports outside PLANE? **YES → Build it** / **NO → Use PLANE UI**
- Do you need data in Excel/BI tools? **YES → Build it** / **NO → Skip it**

---

## 💡 My Recommendation

**Skip Phase 4 for now** unless you have a specific need:

**What you have (Phase 1 + 2):**
- ✅ 33 comprehensive tools
- ✅ All core project management features
- ✅ Sub-issues and relations
- ✅ Labels and bulk operations
- ✅ Search and analytics
- ✅ Comments and formatting

**This covers 95% of typical use cases!**

**Better approach:**
1. ✅ Deploy and use what you have
2. ✅ Gather feedback from actual usage
3. 🔮 Add Phase 4 features **only if you discover you need them**

## 🎯 Alternative Phase 3 Ideas

Instead of Phase 4 "nice-to-haves", consider these **high-value additions**:

### A. Enhanced Search ⭐⭐⭐
- Saved searches/filters
- Advanced query syntax
- Recent searches
- Search suggestions

**Effort:** 1-2 hours  
**Value:** High - improves discovery

### B. Notifications/Activity Feed ⭐⭐
- Get recent activity
- Filter by user/project
- Mention detection
- Lightweight alternative to webhooks

**Effort:** 1-2 hours  
**Value:** Medium-High - semi-proactive awareness

### C. Templates ⭐⭐
- Issue templates
- Project templates
- Common workflows
- Quick issue creation

**Effort:** 1 hour  
**Value:** Medium - saves time on repetitive tasks

---

## 🎊 Current Status

**You have everything you asked for:**
- ✅ Projects, issues, sub-issues
- ✅ Relations and blockers
- ✅ Labels and organization
- ✅ Bulk operations
- ✅ Comments and formatting
- ✅ Search and analytics
- ✅ Auth auto-refresh (optional)

**33 tools ready to use!**

---

## 🤷 So... Phase 4?

**My honest assessment:**

**DON'T build Phase 4 now** - it's solving problems you might not have.

**INSTEAD:**
1. Deploy these 33 tools to Rupert
2. Use them for a week or two
3. See what you actually miss
4. Then build only what you need

**That's the Tim the Toolman way** - build what you need, when you need it! 🔧
