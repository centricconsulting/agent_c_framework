### Notes for Tim

The full API documentation is available at the link above. Tim can reference it as needed during development. We're starting with the core endpoints listed above and will expand based on use cases.

**Tim:** When you need details on specific endpoints, parameters, or responses, refer to the full documentation link. Don't try to implement everything at once - build incrementally based on the use cases we define.
