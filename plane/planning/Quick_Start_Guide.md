# PLANE Integration - Quick Start Guide

## 🚀 Your Next 3 Steps

### Step 1: Prepare (30 minutes)
**What:** Gather PLANE API documentation and define your needs

**Actions:**
1. Access your PLANE instance's API documentation
2. Create account/get API credentials
3. Save API docs to: `//plane/api_docs/`
4. Answer the key questions below

**Key Questions:**
```markdown
1. PLANE Instance URL: _______________
2. Authentication Method: [API Key / Token / OAuth]
3. Default Workspace ID: _______________
4. Top 5 use cases for Rupert:
   - 
   -
   -
   -
   -
```

### Step 2: Define Use Cases (1 hour)
**What:** Document exactly how Rupert will use PLANE

**Actions:**
1. Create `//plane/planning/use_cases.md`
2. List specific workflows Rupert needs
3. Prioritize features (Must Have / Nice to Have / Future)
4. Review with Domo

**Template:**
```markdown
## Use Case: [Name]
**Frequency:** [Daily / Weekly / Monthly]
**Priority:** [High / Medium / Low]
**Description:** ...
**Required PLANE Features:** ...
**Example Interaction:** ...
```

### Step 3: Start Building (Switch Agents)
**What:** Begin tool development with Tim the Toolman

**Actions:**
1. Switch to agent: **Tim the Toolman**
2. Provide him with:
   - API documentation from `//plane/api_docs/`
   - Use cases from `//plane/planning/use_cases.md`
   - This plan: `//plane/planning/PLANE_Integration_Plan.md`
3. Tell him: "Let's start with Phase 2, Task: Set Up Development Environment"

## 💬 Example Conversation with Tim

```
You: Hi Tim! I need your help building custom Agent C tools for PLANE 
     integration with my assistant Rupert. I have the API documentation 
     ready and a detailed plan.

Tim: [responds]

You: Great! Here's what we're working on:
     - API Docs: //plane/api_docs/
     - Plan: //plane/planning/PLANE_Integration_Plan.md
     - Use Cases: //plane/planning/use_cases.md
     
     Can you start with Phase 2, Task 1: "Set Up Development Environment"?
     We need to create the project structure for PLANE tools.

Tim: [begins work]
