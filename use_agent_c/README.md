# "Use Agent C"  

The files in this folder will eventually be distributable in a small zip file allowing the installation of Agent C using Docker / Rancher much quicker.  HOWEVER, these images are in the cotainer registry...

To user this:

1. From the root folder of the project run:
    - ci/build_api_container
    - ci/build_fe_container
2. From this folder run:
   - start_agent_c
