# Agent as Tool

## What This Tool Does

The Agent as Tool capability enables agents to create, manage, and communicate with other specialized agents. This powerful feature allows your main agent (often called the "Majordomo" or "Domo") to delegate tasks to purpose-built sub-agents, creating a collaborative team of AI assistants working together to solve complex problems.

## Key Capabilities

- **Create specialized agents** for specific tasks or domains
- **Delegate work** to the most appropriate agent for each task
- **Enable collaboration** between multiple agents with different capabilities
- **Maintain conversation context** across a network of agents
- **Visualize agent relationships** to understand the team structure
- **Save and load agent configurations** for reuse across sessions

## Practical Use Cases

### Multi-domain Problem Solving

When your questions span multiple areas of expertise, the Majordomo can create and coordinate specialized agents. For example, a project involving financial analysis, legal considerations, and market research could leverage specialized agents for each domain.

### Complex Workflow Orchestration

For multi-step processes that require different skills at each stage, the Majordomo can create a workflow of specialized agents. For instance, one agent might gather data, another might analyze it, and a third might generate a report.

### Simultaneous Task Processing

Multiple agents can work on different aspects of a problem simultaneously, then combine their insights. This parallel processing can be particularly valuable for time-sensitive tasks.

## Example Interactions

### Creating a Specialized Agent

**User**: "I need to analyze some financial data and then create a presentation about it."

**Agent**: "I can help with that! I'll create a Financial Analysis agent to examine your data in depth and a Presentation specialist to craft compelling slides based on the findings. Would you like to proceed with this approach?"

### Agent Collaboration

**User**: "I'm trying to decide which programming language to learn next."

**Agent**: "To give you the best recommendation, I'll consult with specialized agents who focus on different programming ecosystems. One moment while I gather insights from experts in web development, data science, and enterprise software..."

*[After consultation]*

"Based on your background and goals, our team recommends Python as your next language. The Data Science agent highlighted its versatility in analytics, while the Web Development agent noted its growing use in backend systems..."

## Configuration Requirements

The Agent as Tool capability works within the Agent C framework without requiring external API keys or special configuration. It's already integrated into the system.

## Important Considerations

### Performance Impact

Creating multiple agents may require additional computational resources and might introduce slight delays in responses as information is passed between agents.

### Conversation Clarity

The Majordomo will typically summarize the contributions of sub-agents rather than having each agent respond directly, keeping the conversation clear and focused.

### Privacy

Information shared with the Majordomo may be passed to sub-agents as needed to complete tasks. All agents operate within the same security framework and privacy boundaries.

### Persistence

By default, created agents exist only for the duration of your session. However, you can request that agent configurations be saved for future sessions if you frequently need the same specialized assistance.
