# Agent C Tools Documentation

## Overview
This directory contains documentation for the various tools available in the Agent C framework. These tools provide agents with capabilities to interact with external systems, process data, and perform specialized tasks.

## Available Tools

### Information Retrieval
- [Web Search](README_WEB_SEARCH.md): Access multiple search engines and information sources
- [Web Browser](README_WEB.md): Fetch and process web page content
- [RSS Feed](README_RSS.md): Access pre-configured RSS feeds for news and updates
- [Weather](README_WEATHER.md): Retrieve current weather conditions and forecasts for specified locations
- [XML Explorer](README_XML_EXPLORER.md): Parse, query, and extract data from XML documents

### Memory and Data Management
- [Memory](README_MEMORY.md): Store and retrieve persistent data across conversations
- [Workspace](README_WORKSPACE.md): Read, write, and manipulate files in various storage locations

### Data Visualization and Presentation
- [Mermaid Chart](README_MERMAID_CHART.md): Create and render diagrams using Mermaid.js syntax
- [Markdown to HTML Report](README_MARKDOWN_TO_HTML_REPORT.md): Create interactive HTML viewers from markdown files

### Utilities
- [Think](README_THINK.md): Provide a dedicated space for agent reasoning and reflection
- [Random Number](README_RANDOM_NUMBER.md): Generate random numbers for various applications

### Business Integration
- [Dynamics CRM](README_DYNAMICS.md): Interact with Microsoft Dynamics 365 CRM systems

### Content Generation
- [DALL-E](README_DALL_E.md): Generate images from text descriptions using OpenAI's DALL-E model

## Tool Configuration

Many tools require specific configuration, such as API keys or environment variables. Each tool's documentation includes a "Configuration Requirements" section detailing these needs.

Common configuration requirements include:

1. API keys for external services (OpenAI, Google, etc.)
2. Environment variables set in your `.env` file
3. Workspace paths for file storage

## Adding Tools to Agents

To equip an agent with tools:

1. Reference the specific tools needed in your agent's persona
2. Ensure the agent verifies it has access to these tools
3. Include proper error handling for cases where tools are unavailable

Example agent tool verification:

```
First, I should check that I have the tools I need:
- workspace tool for file operations
- web_search for research
- memory for maintaining context

If any of these tools are missing, I will inform the user that I cannot proceed without them.
```

## Security Considerations

When using tools, be mindful of:

- Data privacy: Only store necessary information in memory tools
- API usage: Many tools consume API credits that may have associated costs
- File system access: Workspace operations should be limited to appropriate directories

## Extending the Toolset

Agent C supports custom tool development. If you're interested in creating new tools, refer to the developer documentation for details on the Toolset interface and implementation patterns.
