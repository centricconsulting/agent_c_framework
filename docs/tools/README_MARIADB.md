## Getting Started

### Database Connection
Agents can connect to your MariaDB database using standard connection parameters. You can provide connection details when needed, or agents can use saved connection settings from previous sessions. The connection process includes validation to ensure successful database access.

### Basic Operations
Once connected, agents can immediately begin exploring your database structure, listing tables, examining schemas, and executing queries based on your requests. All operations are designed to be safe and non-destructive.

### Advanced Features
For complex analysis tasks, agents can execute sophisticated queries, export results to Excel files, and provide detailed insights about your data patterns and relationships.

## Security and Safety

### Data Protection
- **Read-only operations** prevent accidental data modification or deletion
- **Query validation** blocks potentially harmful SQL statements
- **Secure connections** protect data transmission between agent and database
- **Access control** respects your database permissions and security settings

### Safe Query Execution
- **SQL injection prevention** validates all user inputs and query parameters
- **Operation restrictions** limit operations to SELECT statements only
- **Error containment** handles database errors gracefully without exposing sensitive information
- **Connection management** properly closes connections to prevent resource leaks

## Integration Benefits

### Enhanced Productivity
- **Rapid data exploration** eliminates the need to manually write exploratory queries
- **Automated documentation** generates schema documentation without manual effort
- **Intelligent insights** provides analysis that might be missed in manual review
- **Streamlined workflows** integrates database operations with other agent capabilities

### Improved Accuracy
- **Validated queries** reduce errors from manual SQL writing
