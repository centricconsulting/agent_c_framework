## Agent Memory and Preferences

### What This Means for You

Agents equipped with workspace tools can now remember information about you, your preferences, and your ongoing work across multiple conversations. This creates a more personalized and continuous experience where the agent builds understanding over time.

### How Agent Memory Works

The agent stores information in a structured way within your workspace, creating a persistent memory that survives between sessions. This means:

- **Your preferences are remembered** - coding styles, communication preferences, project details
- **Work context is preserved** - the agent knows where you left off on projects
- **Learning accumulates** - the agent gets better at helping you over time
- **Settings persist** - configuration and customization choices are maintained

### What Agents Can Remember

#### Personal Preferences
- **Communication Style**: How detailed you like explanations, whether you prefer examples
- **Technical Preferences**: Programming languages you use, frameworks you prefer
- **Work Patterns**: Times you're most active, types of projects you work on
- **Learning Style**: How you like information presented, your expertise level

#### Project Context
- **Current Projects**: What you're working on and project status
- **Goals and Objectives**: Your short-term and long-term project goals
- **Team Information**: Collaborators, roles, and communication preferences
- **Technical Stack**: Technologies, tools, and configurations you use

#### Session Continuity
- **Previous Conversations**: Context from earlier discussions
- **Ongoing Tasks**: Multi-session work that spans several conversations
- **Decision History**: Choices made and reasoning behind them
- **Progress Tracking**: What's been completed and what's next

### Benefits of Agent Memory

#### Personalized Experience
- Agents adapt their communication style to your preferences
- Suggestions become more relevant based on your history
- Less repetition of basic information in each conversation
- More efficient interactions as the agent learns your patterns

#### Project Continuity
- Pick up complex projects exactly where you left off
- Maintain context across multiple work sessions
- Track progress and milestones automatically
- Remember decisions and their rationale

#### Improved Efficiency
- No need to re-explain your preferences each time
- Faster problem-solving based on learned patterns
- Better suggestions based on your work history
- Reduced setup time for recurring tasks

## Configuration Requirements

Workspaces are configured by your administrator. Typically, you'll have access to one or more workspaces such as:
- A personal workspace for your private files
- Possibly shared workspaces for team collaboration
- Special-purpose workspaces for specific projects or applications

## Advanced File Operations

### Code Analysis and Inspection

The workspace tool includes powerful code analysis capabilities that allow agents to understand code structure without reading entire files:

#### Code Inspection
- **`inspect_code`**: Analyzes code files and provides structural overview
- **Signature Extraction**: Gets method/function signatures and documentation
- **Line Number Mapping**: Provides precise line numbers for targeted operations
- **Efficient Updates**: Enables surgical code changes without full file rewrites

#### Targeted File Operations
- **`read_lines`**: Read specific line ranges from files
- **`replace_strings`**: Make multiple targeted string replacements in a single operation
- **Batch Updates**: Combine multiple changes to minimize file operations

### Search and Discovery

#### Pattern Matching
- **`glob`**: Find files using wildcard patterns
- **Recursive Search**: Search through directory trees
- **Hidden File Support**: Include or exclude hidden files

#### Content Search
- **`grep`**: Search file contents using regular expressions
- **Multi-file Search**: Search across multiple files simultaneously
- **Case-insensitive Options**: Flexible text matching
- **Line Number Results**: Precise location of matches

### File Management

#### Copy and Move Operations
- **`cp`**: Copy files and directories within workspaces
- **`mv`**: Move/rename files and directories
- **Atomic Operations**: Safe file operations with error handling

#### Directory Operations
- **`ls`**: List directory contents with detailed information
- **`tree`**: Generate hierarchical directory views
- **`is_directory`**: Check if paths are directories
- **Automatic Directory Creation**: Parent directories created automatically

## Important Considerations

### Working with Files

When requesting file operations:
- Specify which workspace and file path you're referring to using UNC paths (//WORKSPACE/path)
- Be clear about what changes you want made to files
- For code files, agents can use `inspect_code` to understand structure before making changes
- Use `replace_strings` for targeted updates rather than rewriting entire files

### File Organization

For effective workspace management:
- Consider establishing a consistent folder structure for your projects
- Use descriptive filenames that indicate content and purpose
- Use `tree` command to visualize and organize directory structures
- Leverage `glob` patterns to find and organize related files

### Performance Best Practices

- **Batch Operations**: Combine multiple file changes into single operations when possible
- **Targeted Updates**: Use `inspect_code` + `read_lines` + `replace_strings` for efficient code changes
- **Metadata for Memory**: Use workspace metadata instead of files for agent memory and settings
- **Search Before Read**: Use `grep` and `glob` to locate content before reading files

### File Persistence

- Files and metadata saved in workspaces remain available in future conversations
- You can continue work on documents across multiple sessions
- The agent can recall and reference previous work stored in your workspace
- Metadata provides faster access to structured data than file-based storage

### Workspace Limitations

- Each workspace has boundaries set by your administrator
- The agent can only access files within configured workspaces
- Very large files or certain file types may have handling limitations
- File operations (copy/move) must be within the same workspace
- Some workspaces may be read-only, preventing write operations

## Enhanced File and Content Management
