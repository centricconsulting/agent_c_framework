## Example Interactions

### Basic Image Creation

**User**: "Create an image of a cozy cabin in the woods surrounded by pine trees with smoke coming from the chimney."

**Agent**: *Generates and displays a detailed image of a cabin in a forest setting, with visible smoke rising from its chimney.*

### Stylistic Customization

**User**: "I need a professional-looking portrait of a female CEO in a modern office, but make it look natural, not too artificial."

**Agent**: *Creates a natural-style portrait image in portrait orientation, explaining that it used the natural style and tall ratio for best results.*

### Conceptual Visualization

**User**: "Generate an image showing the concept of 'digital transformation' for my presentation."

**Agent**: *Produces a conceptual image that visualizes digital transformation, perhaps showing traditional objects morphing into digital versions, with explanations of the visual metaphors used.*

## Configuration Requirements

This tool requires an OpenAI API key with DALL-E-3 access. Your administrator or IT department should ensure this is properly configured for your agent.

## Important Considerations

### Image Quality Options

- **Standard Quality**: Good for most everyday purposes
- **HD Quality**: Higher detail level, ideal for professional use or when fine details matter

### Image Formats

You can request different aspect ratios to suit your needs:
- **Square**: Equal height and width (default)
- **Wide**: Landscape orientation, good for scenes or desktop wallpapers
- **Tall**: Portrait orientation, ideal for phone wallpapers or profile pictures

### Style Options

- **Vivid**: Creates hyper-real, dramatic images with bold colors and contrast (default)
- **Natural**: Produces more realistic, less stylized images

### Tips for Best Results

- Provide detailed descriptions including subject, setting, lighting, and mood
- Specify the purpose of the image to help the agent choose appropriate settings
- Mention specific artistic styles if you want the image to have a particular look
- Consider requesting multiple variations if you're not sure exactly what you want

### Limitations

- The tool cannot generate images containing explicit content, violence, or specific public figures
- Very complex scenes with many specific elements might not render exactly as described
- Generated images do not include readable text (text may appear distorted)
- Each image generation uses API credits from your organization's account
