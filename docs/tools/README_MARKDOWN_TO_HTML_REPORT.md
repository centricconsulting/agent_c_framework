## Example Interactions

### Creating Documentation from Project Files

**User**: "Can you generate an HTML report from all the markdown files in our project's documentation folder?"

**Agent**: *Creates an interactive HTML viewer containing all documentation files, preserving their structure and links between documents, then provides a link to access the report.*

### Creating a Research Knowledge Base

**User**: "I have a collection of research notes in markdown format in my 'research' folder. Can you create a navigable HTML report from them called 'Research Findings' but exclude my 'draft.md' and 'personal_notes.md' files?"

**Agent**: *Generates a custom HTML report with the specified title, excluding the mentioned files, and provides access instructions.*

### Packaging Client Deliverables

**User**: "I need to send our client a report based on the analysis markdown files we've created. Can you package them as a professional-looking HTML page?"

**Agent**: *Converts the analysis files into a polished HTML report with proper navigation and structure, then explains how the client can access and use the report.*

## Configuration Requirements

No special configuration is required to use this tool. The agent will need access to the workspace containing your markdown files.

## Important Considerations

### File Organization

The HTML report will preserve your folder structure, so organizing your markdown files in a logical hierarchy will result in a better navigation experience in the final report.

### Customization Options

When requesting a report, you can specify:
- A custom title for the report
- Specific files to exclude from the report
- The location where you want the HTML file saved

### Features of Generated Reports

The HTML reports include several helpful features:
- A sidebar showing the complete file structure
- Dark/light mode toggle for comfortable reading

### Sharing Reports

The generated HTML file is self-contained and can be shared with others by:
- Emailing the HTML file
- Uploading to a shared drive or website
- Presenting directly from your device in meetings
