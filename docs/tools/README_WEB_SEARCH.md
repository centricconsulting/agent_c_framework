### Problem-Solving Support

**User**: "I'm getting an 'ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED' error on my website. What might be causing this?"

**Agent**: *Searches for technical information about this specific error, then synthesizes solutions from various sources to provide troubleshooting steps and potential fixes.*

## Configuration Requirements

This tool requires API keys for certain search providers. Your administrator should ensure the appropriate API keys are configured for the search capabilities you need.

## Important Considerations

### Information Sources

The tool can access information from various sources including:
- General web search results (Google)
- News articles from multiple publishers
- Wikipedia articles for background information
- Research databases for academic or specialized content
- Financial news sources for market information
- Technical forums for specialized topics

### Information Currency

- Search results reflect what's currently available online
- The agent can find information published minutes ago to years ago
- For very recent events (within hours), news search is typically most effective
- Historical information can be found but may require more specific search terms

### Search Effectiveness

For best results when requesting searches:
- Be specific about what information you're looking for
- Mention time frames if relevant (e.g., "in the past month")
- Specify if you want a particular type of information (news, research papers, etc.)
- Indicate if you need information from specific sources or domains

### Limitations

- While the agent can search the web, it cannot access information behind logins or paywalls
- Very recent breaking news (within minutes) may not yet be indexed by search engines
- The agent summarizes information from multiple sources but may not capture every detail
- Search operations use API credits which may have associated usage limits
