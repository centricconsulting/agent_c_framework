# Web Tool

## What This Tool Does

The Web Tool enables agents to access and interact with web pages during your conversation. This capability allows you to get information from specific websites without having to leave the chat, switch applications, or copy-paste content back and forth.

## Key Capabilities

Agents equipped with this tool can help you work with web content in various ways:

- **Information Extraction**: Get clean, readable content from articles, blog posts, and web pages
- **Research Assistance**: Access specific information from websites you're interested in
- **Content Summarization**: Obtain and summarize key points from longer web articles
- **Reference Collection**: Save important web content for later use in your projects
- **Visual Access**: View the original web page when needed for visual elements or interaction

## Practical Use Cases

- **Knowledge Gathering**: Access specific articles or documentation during research
- **Current Information**: Get up-to-date content from specific web pages
- **Content Analysis**: Review articles or blog posts without switching between apps
- **Documentation Reference**: Access technical documentation during problem-solving
- **Learning Support**: Retrieve tutorial content or educational resources

## Example Interactions

### Retrieving Article Content

**User**: "Can you get the content from this article and summarize the key points? https://example.com/article-on-climate-technology"

**Agent**: *Retrieves the article content, removes ads and navigation elements, and presents a clean version of the text along with a summary of the main points.*

### Research Support

**User**: "I'm researching artificial intelligence regulations. Can you check what the EU AI Act page says about high-risk AI systems?"

**Agent**: *Fetches content from the relevant EU website, extracts the specific information about high-risk AI systems, and presents it in a readable format.*

### Documentation Access

**User**: "I'm trying to use the pandas library in Python but I'm stuck on how to merge dataframes. Can you check the pandas documentation for me?"

**Agent**: *Retrieves the relevant documentation page, extracts the information about dataframe merging, and presents the explanation with examples in a clear format.*

## Configuration Requirements

No special configuration is required to use this tool. The agent can access public web pages without additional setup.

## Important Considerations

### Content Access

- The tool works best with text-based content like articles, documentation, and blog posts
- Some websites may block automated access, preventing the agent from retrieving content
- The agent can only access publicly available content, not pages behind logins or paywalls

### Content Processing

When retrieving web content, the agent:
- Removes ads, navigation menus, and other clutter
- Preserves important text content and basic formatting
- Converts complex layouts into readable formats
- May not preserve all images or interactive elements

### Web Page Display

You can ask the agent to show you the original web page when:
- Visual elements are important for understanding
- You need to interact with the page directly
- The content formatting is complex or specialized

### Content Storage

For important web information:
- You can request that the agent save the content to a workspace for later reference
- The agent will provide information about where the content is stored
- Saved content is converted to markdown format for easy reading and reference
