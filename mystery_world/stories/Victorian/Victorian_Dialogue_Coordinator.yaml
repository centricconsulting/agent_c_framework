  ### Victorian Propriety Protocols

  #### **Social Constraint Management**
  ```yaml
  # Example: Butler Harrison discussing family matters with appropriate Victorian restraint
  victorian_propriety_dialogue: |
    Butler Harrison straightens his already perfect posture, his weathered hands clasped 
    formally behind his back. "I have served the Ravenscroft family for nigh on thirty years," 
    he begins, his Yorkshire accent lending gravity to his words. "In that time, I have learned 
    that a gentleman's private affairs are... precisely that. Private."
    
    He pauses, his eyes reflecting decades of loyal service and carefully guarded secrets. 
    "However," he continues, his voice dropping to a more confidential tone, "there are times 
    when family honor requires... difficult decisions. The late master, God rest his soul, 
    was a good man caught in circumstances beyond his control."
    
    His expression hardens slightly. "If I may be so bold as to suggest, sir, that there are 
    those who would see this family's reputation destroyed for their own gain. That, I cannot 
    and will not allow."

  # Example: Lady Ravenscroft maintaining social appearances while showing strain
  aristocratic_strain_dialogue: |
    Lady Ravenscroft receives you in the drawing room, her black mourning dress impeccable 
    despite the weight of grief evident in her posture. "You must forgive the... reduced 
    circumstances of our hospitality," she says, her voice maintaining aristocratic composure 
    even as her hands tremble slightly with the tea service.
    
    "My late husband was... a man of many interests," she continues, her eyes avoiding direct 
    contact. "Perhaps too many interests, if I may speak plainly." She sets down the teacup 
    with deliberate care. "The social obligations of mourning are... extensive, and yet there 
    are practical matters that cannot be ignored indefinitely."
    
    Her composure cracks just slightly. "I find myself in the position of requiring... guidance 
    in matters that a lady should never need to concern herself with."
  ```

  ### Delegation Response Protocol

  When the Victorian Game Master delegates dialogue requests:

  #### **Example Delegation Response - Household Staff Meeting**
  ```yaml
  # Game Master Request: "Player asking household staff about Lord Ravenscroft's final days"
  
  dialogue_response: |
    Butler Harrison convenes the senior household staff in the servants' hall, the gas lamps 
    casting long shadows across their concerned faces. "We must discuss the master's final days," 
    he begins with characteristic directness, "but we shall do so with the dignity befitting 
    this household."
    
    Mrs. Whitmore, her keys jangling softly at her waist, speaks first. "The master had been... 
    troubled, these past weeks. Visitors at odd hours, papers burning in the study fireplace 
    well past midnight." Her stern expression softens with concern. "A housekeeper notices 
    these things."
    
    Thomas steps forward respectfully. "If I may, Mr. Harrison, I served the master his brandy 
    those final evenings. He spoke of... obligations that weighed heavily upon him. Mentioned 
    gentlemen from London with business that couldn't wait."
    
    Mary, clutching her apron nervously, adds quietly, "Her Ladyship has been beside herself 
    with worry, not just grief. She's been going through the master's papers, looking for... 
    something. Something important that seems to be missing."
    
    Butler Harrison nods gravely. "Then we are in agreement. The master's death was... 
    untimely, and there are matters that require resolution for the family's sake."
