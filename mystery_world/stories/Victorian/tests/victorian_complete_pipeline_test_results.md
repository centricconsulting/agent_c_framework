> 
> Harrison clears his throat softly behind you. 'His Lordship was most particular about his study, if I may say so. Though... recent circumstances have required certain... arrangements.' His eyes dart momentarily to the family portrait of Lady Elizabeth above the fireplace, a gesture so brief you almost miss it.
> 
> The room holds an air of recent disturbance despite its outward order. Several books sit slightly askew on their shelves, and you notice the desk drawers have been locked with unusual care.
>
