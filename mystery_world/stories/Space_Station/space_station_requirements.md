# Space Station Mystery - Design Requirements

## User-Specified Requirements

### Scientific Accuracy
- **Level**: Valid and appropriate but not overly descriptive
- **Token Efficiency**: Avoid excessive technical detail that wastes tokens
- **Approach**: Accurate but concise scientific elements

### AI Consciousness
- **Level**: Minimal and limited but accurate
- **Approach**: Leave users wanting more rather than overwhelming
- **Implementation**: Subtle AI presence, not dominant

### Multi-Species Integration
- **Requirement**: Include a couple of fun alien characters
- **Interaction**: Meaningful interaction with human crews
- **Balance**: Enhance story without overwhelming human dynamics

### Technology Level
- **Setting**: Near-future realistic
- **Approach**: Grounded in plausible science and technology
- **Avoid**: Far-future speculative elements

### Mystery Focus
- **Central Mystery**: Locating the right star in space that has a special alien needing rescue
- **Theme**: Space navigation and alien rescue mission
- **Scope**: Star-finding mystery with alien character integration

### Investigation Methods
- **Constraint**: Detective work should NOT be super affected by space environment
- **Approach**: Familiar investigation techniques adapted to space setting
- **Balance**: Space elements enhance rather than complicate investigation

### Social Dynamics
- **Structure**: Advanced, neat, fun civilian structures
- **Avoid**: Military hierarchy complexity
- **Focus**: Interesting civilian space community dynamics

### Hazard Integration
- **Level**: Important but not main focus
- **Constraint**: Should not take away from other mystery aspects
- **Role**: Background tension, not primary obstacle

## Implementation Guidelines

### Token Efficiency Priorities
1. Concise but accurate scientific elements
2. Minimal AI descriptions with maximum impact
3. Efficient alien character integration
4. Streamlined civilian social structures

### Content Balance
- **Primary Focus**: Star-finding rescue mystery
- **Secondary Elements**: Alien characters, civilian dynamics
- **Background Elements**: Hazards, AI presence, technical systems

### Testing Approach
- Create templates following these requirements
- Test pipeline efficiency vs Victorian baseline
- Validate content quality meets specifications
- Ensure mystery focus remains clear throughout
