# Removed Files Log - Space Station Reorganization

## Files Removed to Eliminate Duplication

The following files were removed after their content was reorganized into the modular structure:

### Original Consolidated World File
- `kepler_station_test.yaml` - Content broken down into individual room and object files

### Template Files (Generic, replaced by specific agents)
- `mystery_game_master_template_space.yaml` - Replaced by `Space_Station_Game_Master.yaml`
- `mystery_character_specialist_template_space.yaml` - Generic template, not needed for specific world
- `mystery_tutorial_guide_template_space.yaml` - Generic template, not needed for specific world  
- `mystery_environment_specialist_template_space.yaml` - Generic template, not needed for specific world

### Reason for Removal
These files contained duplicated information that is now properly organized in:
- Dedicated Space Station agents (Game Master and Assistant)
- Individual room files in `/rooms/` folder
- Categorized object files in `/objects/` folder

The removal eliminates redundancy while preserving all content in a more organized, maintainable structure.
