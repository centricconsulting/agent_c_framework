## Template Performance Assessment

### Test Output Analysis
```yaml
test_scenario: "Research laboratory where crew analyzes star charts for alien rescue"
generated_content: |
  "The xenobiology research lab pulses with soft amber lighting from bio-containment 
  units lining the curved walls. Holographic star maps float above the central analysis 
  table, showing candidate systems highlighted in blue—three already marked with red X's 
  after failed trajectory calculations. Dr. Chen's coffee grows cold beside her as she 
  manipulates a 3D projection of the Kepler-442 system, its habitable zone rotating 
  slowly while atmospheric data streams across auxiliary monitors. The gentle thrum of 
  the station's rotation mingles with the whispered discussions between the navigation 
  team, their voices barely audible over the subtle hiss of the atmospheric recyclers. 
  Emergency stellar cartography protocols remain sealed in the wall panel, their amber 
  warning light casting shadows across abandoned meal trays—evidence of the crew's 
  desperate, round-the-clock search for the perfect star system to guide their alien 
  refugees to safety."
