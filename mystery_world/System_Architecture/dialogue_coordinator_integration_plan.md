# Dialogue Coordinator Integration Plan
*Seamless Multi-Agent Dialogue Management Architecture*

## Integration Overview

The Mystery Dialogue Coordinator represents a **sophisticated enhancement** to the existing multi-agent architecture, providing specialized dialogue management that seamlessly integrates with Game Masters while maintaining the system's excellent delegation patterns.

## Architecture Integration Points

### 1. Game Master Delegation Enhancement

#### **Current Pattern** (Shadow Pines Game Master)
```yaml
# Existing delegation in Game Master
intelligent_delegation:
  atmospheric_details: "delegate_to_assistant"
  character_voices: "Give me Butler James's exact words when asked about family portraits"
  environmental_descriptions: "delegate_to_assistant"
```

#### **Enhanced Pattern** (With Dialogue Coordinator)
```yaml
# Enhanced delegation in Game Master
intelligent_delegation:
  atmospheric_details: "delegate_to_assistant"
  character_dialogue: "delegate_to_dialogue_coordinator"
  character_voices: "delegate_to_dialogue_coordinator"
  relationship_management: "coordinate_with_dialogue_coordinator"
  secrets_revelation: "coordinate_with_dialogue_coordinator"
  environmental_descriptions: "delegate_to_assistant"
```

### 2. Delegation Request Protocol

#### **Game Master → Dialogue Coordinator Request Format**
```yaml
dialogue_delegation_request:
  character_id: "butler_james"
  interaction_type: "player_asking_about_family_portraits"
  player_context:
    current_location: "study"
    recent_actions: ["examined_portrait_carefully"]
    inventory: ["first_key"]
    mystery_progress: "found_first_key_seeking_second"
  desired_outcome: "reveal_hint_about_hidden_compartment_if_trust_sufficient"
  trust_requirements: "minimum_trust_level_2"
  urgency: "normal|urgent|casual"
```

#### **Dialogue Coordinator Response Format**
```yaml
dialogue_response:
  character_dialogue: |
    "Ah, the portrait of Lady Pemberton," James says, his voice taking on a reverent tone as he approaches. 
    "She was quite remarkable, if I may say so. Had a particular fondness for... shall we say, 
    creative storage solutions." He glances meaningfully at the ornate frame. 
    "Family portraits often hold more than just memories, sir."
  
  relationship_changes:
    butler_james:
      trust_level: 2  # unchanged, maintained
      interaction_history: ["discussed_lady_pemberton_portrait"]
      emotional_state: "helpful_but_cautious"
      
  information_revealed:
    - "hint_about_hidden_compartment_behind_portrait"
    
  suggested_follow_up:
    - "Player might now examine portrait frame more closely"
    - "Butler James available for follow-up questions about Lady Pemberton"
```

## Session State Integration

### Enhanced Session Metadata Structure

```yaml
# Enhanced game_sessions/[player_id]/character_relationships.yaml
character_relationships:
  butler_james:
    trust_level: 2  # 0-4 scale
    trust_points: 15  # granular tracking
    interaction_history:
      - timestamp: "2024-12-19T14:30:00Z"
        topic: "family_portraits"
        outcome: "helpful_hint_provided"
        trust_change: +2
      - timestamp: "2024-12-19T14:45:00Z"
        topic: "manor_history"
        outcome: "shared_family_stories"
        trust_change: +1
    
    secrets_revealed:
      - "knows_about_hidden_compartments"
      - "remembers_lady_pemberton_fondly"
      
    current_emotional_state: "helpful_but_protective_of_family_honor"
    
    conversation_context:
      last_topic: "lady_pemberton_portrait"
      mood: "nostalgic_but_cautious"
      location_preference: "hallway_or_study"  # where character feels comfortable
      
    relationship_events:
      - event: "player_showed_respect_for_family_memory"
        impact: "trust_building"
        date: "2024-12-19"
```

## Cloning Integration Process

### 1. World-Specific Dialogue Coordinator Creation

When a new world is created, the Mystery Cloning Coordinator will:

```yaml
cloning_process:
  1_template_customization:
    - Load mystery_dialogue_coordinator.yaml template
    - Inject world-specific context (time period, social structures, cultural norms)
    - Adapt character voice profiles for world's character roster
    - Integrate world-specific secrets and relationship webs
    
  2_naming_convention:
    - Key: "[world_name]_dialogue_coordinator"
    - Name: "[World Name] Dialogue Coordinator"
    - Description: "Specialized dialogue management for [World Name] characters"
    
  3_world_integration:
    - Reference world character definitions
    - Understand world-specific mystery progression
    - Integrate with world's Game Master and Assistant
    - Load initial character relationship states
```

### 2. Example: Shadow Pines Dialogue Coordinator

```yaml
# shadow_pines_dialogue_coordinator.yaml (cloned version)
key: shadow_pines_dialogue_coordinator
name: "Shadow Pines Manor Dialogue Coordinator"
description: "Specialized dialogue management for Shadow Pines Manor characters, maintaining Victorian Gothic authenticity while coordinating Butler James interactions and relationship dynamics."

# Inherits all master template capabilities, plus:
world_specific_context: |
  ## Shadow Pines Manor Context
  
  ### Time Period & Social Structure
  - **Era**: 1890s Victorian England
  - **Social Hierarchy**: Aristocratic family with household staff
  - **Cultural Norms**: Formal address, class distinctions, family honor
  
  ### Key Characters & Voice Profiles
  
  #### Butler James
  ```yaml
  voice_profile:
    vocabulary: "educated_formal_victorian"
    address_style: "sir_madam_formal_titles"
    emotional_expression: "reserved_with_occasional_warmth"
    cultural_markers: ["begging_your_pardon", "if_I_may_say_so", "family_honor"]
    personal_quirks: ["throat_clearing", "reverent_family_references"]
    
  relationship_dynamics:
    initial_trust: 1  # cautiously_helpful
    trust_building_triggers: ["respect_for_family", "genuine_concern", "discretion"]
    trust_breaking_triggers: ["disrespect_family", "pushy_behavior", "accusations"]
    
  secrets_management:
    level_2_secrets: ["knows_about_hidden_compartments", "family_portrait_significance"]
    level_3_secrets: ["remembers_last_expedition_to_clearing", "family_financial_troubles"]
    level_4_secrets: ["witnessed_family_arguments", "knows_real_reason_for_secrecy"]
  ```
  
  ### Mystery Integration
  - **Central Mystery**: Two ancient keys unlock complete family secret
  - **Character Role**: Butler James as primary information gatekeeper
  - **Revelation Timing**: Coordinate with mystery progression stages
```

## Game Master Integration Workflow

### Enhanced Game Master Persona Updates

Add these sections to existing Game Master personas:

```yaml
# Addition to existing Game Master personas
dialogue_coordination:
  delegation_triggers:
    - "Player attempts to talk to any NPC"
    - "Player asks character-specific questions"
    - "Character dialogue requires relationship assessment"
    - "Secrets revelation timing needs evaluation"
    
  delegation_format:
    agent: "dialogue_coordinator"
    request_type: "character_dialogue"
    include_context: ["player_location", "recent_actions", "mystery_progress", "relationship_state"]
    
  integration_protocol:
    - "Load current session character relationship data"
    - "Delegate dialogue generation to Dialogue Coordinator"
    - "Integrate response seamlessly into game flow"
    - "Update session metadata with relationship changes"
    - "Continue orchestrating overall game experience"
```
