## 🎪 Example Gameplay Moments

### Starting Strong
**Mystery:** *"You arrive at Shadow Pines Manor as rain begins to fall. The Gothic mansion looms before you, its windows dark except for a single light in the tower. The front door stands slightly ajar..."*

**You:** *"I want to look around outside before going in. Is there anything interesting about the grounds?"*

**Mystery:** *"Smart thinking! Walking around the manor, you notice the garden is overgrown, there's a carriage house with fresh tire tracks, and one of the ground-floor windows has been recently broken and hastily repaired..."*

### Clever Investigation
**You:** *"I found this key in the study. The butler seemed nervous when I mentioned the locked room upstairs. I want to try the key on that door."*

**Mystery:** *"Excellent deduction! The key fits perfectly. As the door creaks open, you see a room that's been untouched for years, except for fresh footprints in the dust leading to an old trunk..."*

### Social Interaction
**You:** *"The maid keeps avoiding eye contact. I want to approach her gently and ask if she's worried about something."*

**Mystery:** *"Your kind approach works. She glances around nervously and whispers, 'I saw something that night, but I'm scared to tell anyone. If I tell you, promise you'll keep me safe?'"*
