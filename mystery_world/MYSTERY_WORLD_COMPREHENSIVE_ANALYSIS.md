'Good evening,' he says in his measured Yorkshire accent, though his eyes don't quite meet yours. 'I trust you're finding the manor... comfortable?'"

You: "I'm more interested in what happened to Lady Pemberton's emerald necklace"

System: "James's polishing cloth stills completely. For a moment, the only sound is the grandfather clock ticking in the hallway. 'That's... that's a delicate matter,' he says carefully, glancing toward the door. 'Perhaps we might speak somewhere more private? The conservatory is quite lovely this time of evening...'"
```

**Step 6: Build Relationships and Solve Puzzles**
