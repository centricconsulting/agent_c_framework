# Agent Type Guides

This directory contains comprehensive guides for building different types of agents using the binary component decision model. Each guide provides clear YES/NO decisions for which components to include and how to structure the agent persona.

## What's in This Directory

### Core Agent Types

- **domo_agent_guide.md** - Agents that interact directly with users
- **orchestrator_agent_guide.md** - Agents that coordinate teams or manage complex workflows  
- **specialist_agent_guide.md** - Domain experts that serve specific technical roles in teams
- **realtime_agent_guide.md** - Voice-optimized agents for conversational interaction
- **gatekeeper_agent_guide.md** - Agents requiring strict approval protocols and compliance oversight
- **documentation_agent_guide.md** - Agents focused on content creation and client-ready preparation

## Guide Structure

Each agent type guide includes:

### When to Use This Type
- Clear scenarios and use cases
- Core characteristics that define this agent type
- Typical roles and responsibilities

### Binary Component Decisions  
- **Component Name**: YES/NO decision with rationale
- Clear criteria for each component inclusion decision
- Variant selection guidance (e.g., General vs Development Human Pairing)

### Typical Structure
- Recommended persona organization
- Component ordering and placement
- Required sections and optional customizations

### Customization Guidance
- What to adapt for specific needs
- Domain-specific considerations
- Integration with other agent types

### Real Examples
- Links to existing agents of this type
- Before/after composition examples
- Component selection rationale

## Binary Decision Benefits

**For Agent Builders**:
- ðŸŽ¯ **Clear Decisions**: Simple YES/NO choices eliminate analysis paralysis
- âš¡ **Faster Creation**: Component decisions vs. crafting from scratch  
- ðŸ“š **Proven Patterns**: Each component is tested and validated
- ðŸ”„ **Consistent Results**: Same decisions yield same components

**For Agent Quality**:
- **Predictable Behavior**: Agents with same components behave consistently
- **Complete Implementation**: Binary choice prevents partial patterns
- **Quality Baseline**: Components embed best practices
- **Easy Validation**: Clear criteria for component appropriateness

## Getting Started

1. **Choose Agent Type**: Select the guide that matches your agent's primary role
2. **Follow Binary Decisions**: Go through each component with YES/NO choices
3. **Select Variants**: Choose appropriate component variants for your focus
4. **Customize Structure**: Adapt the typical structure for your specific needs
5. **Add Domain Expertise**: Include specialized knowledge using component templates
6. **Validate Composition**: Ensure component selections align with agent purpose

This approach maintains the craft and creativity of agent design while providing clear guidance and proven building blocks.
