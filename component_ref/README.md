# Agent Component Reference Library

**A curated collection of proven instruction patterns for Agent C builders**

*Version 1.1 - Binary Decision Model*

---

## What is the Component Reference Library?

The Agent Component Reference Library is a **knowledge capture system** that transforms the art of agent building into a more systematic craft. Instead of starting from scratch each time, agent builders can leverage **proven instruction patterns** that have been validated across 74+ agents in the Agent C ecosystem.

### The Challenge We Solve

Building high-quality agents requires deep understanding of:
- Complex instruction patterns that actually work
- Subtle interactions between different capabilities
- Edge cases and failure modes discovered through experience  
- Quality standards that prevent common pitfalls

Without systematic knowledge capture, each builder must rediscover these patterns through trial and error.

### Our Solution: Reference Components

**Reference Components** are not automation tools - they are **curated building blocks** that capture proven instruction patterns. Each component includes:

- **📝 Proven instruction text** - The actual working pattern
- **🎯 Clear usage criteria** - When and how to apply it
- **🔧 Customization guidance** - How to adapt for your needs
- **📊 Real examples** - Agents successfully using this pattern
- **📈 Evolution history** - How this pattern has improved over time

## The Binary Decision Model

### Simple YES/NO Choices

Gone are complex "beginner to advanced" tiers that create analysis paralysis. The **Binary Decision Model** uses simple YES/NO questions:

```
Building a New Agent:
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Does this agent coordinate work?    │
│ → YES: Use Planning Component       │
│ → NO:  Skip planning component      │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Does this agent delegate to clones? │
│ → YES: Use Clone Delegation         │
│ → NO:  Skip clone delegation        │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Does this agent interact with users?│
│ → YES: Use Human Pairing Component  │
│ → NO:  Skip human pairing           │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Focused Variants, Not Complexity Tiers

Instead of "Standard → Advanced" progressions, we provide **focused variants**:

- **Human Pairing (General Focus)** - For general-purpose user agents  
- **Human Pairing (Development Focus)** - For coding and technical agents
- **Code Quality (Python)** - For Python development agents
- **Code Quality (C#)** - For C# development agents

Each variant is complete and purpose-built, not a stepped progression.

### No Conditional Logic

Components are **standalone instruction blocks** that work independently:
- ✅ Copy the full component text into your agent persona
- ✅ Customize specific details for your use case  
- ✅ Components don't depend on each other
- ❌ No `{{#if condition}}` complexity to manage
- ❌ No state machines or complex prompt logic

---

## Why This Approach Works

### 🎯 **Clear Decisions** 
Simple YES/NO choices eliminate decision paralysis and ensure consistent implementation.

### ⚡ **Faster Agent Creation**
Reference proven patterns instead of crafting from scratch. Typical speed improvement: **60-80% faster**.

### 🏗️ **Preserves the Craft**
You're still designing agents thoughtfully - just with better building blocks and clearer decisions.

### 📈 **Continuous Improvement** 
Components evolve as we learn better patterns. Use the latest version for your agents.

### 🎨 **Full Customization**
Every component can be modified for your specific needs. Reference components are starting points, not constraints.

## Quick Start Guide

### For New Agent Builders

**Step 1: Choose Your Agent Type**
- **Domo Agent** - Direct user interaction
- **Orchestrator** - Coordinates teams/workflows  
- **Specialist (Assist)** - Technical expert for teams
- **Realtime** - Voice-optimized conversation
- **Documentation** - Content creation and organization

**Step 2: Use the Agent Type Guide**
Navigate to [02_agent_type_guides](./02_agent_type_guides/) and find your agent type. Each guide provides:
- Clear binary decision criteria for each component
- Recommended agent structure and component order
- Real examples of agents built with this pattern

**Step 3: Make Binary Component Decisions**
For each component, ask: "Does my agent need this capability?"
- YES → Copy the component into your agent persona
- NO → Skip this component entirely

**Step 4: Customize and Compose**
- Add your domain expertise and personality
- Modify component details for your specific use case
- Test your agent and refine as needed
