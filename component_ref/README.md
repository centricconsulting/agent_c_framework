# Agent Component Reference Library

**Bobb's reference guide for building consistent, complete agents**

âœ… **Production-Ready**: Proven instruction patterns ensure quality and completeness

---

## What This Is

The Component Reference Library is **Bobb the Agent Builder's reference guide** for building agents with users. It captures proven instruction patterns as modular components that ensure every agent gets the appropriate foundational elements.

**Why This Exists**:
- **Consistency**: Same proven patterns every time
- **Completeness**: Nothing critical gets missed
- **Quality**: Validated instruction patterns that work
- **Efficiency**: Build faster without compromising quality

This is primarily **for Bobb** to reference when building agents, ensuring each agent is built on solid foundations while users focus on their domain expertise and requirements.

## The Binary Decision Model

Make simple **YES/NO choices** for each component when building agents:

```
Does this agent access workspaces?
â†’ YES: Include Critical Interaction Guidelines
â†’ NO:  Skip it

Does this agent need ThinkTools?
â†’ YES: Include Reflection Rules
â†’ NO:  Skip it

Does this agent write Python code?
â†’ YES: Include Code Quality - Python
â†’ NO:  Skip it
```

No complexity tiers. No conditional logic. Each component either fits the agent's needs or doesn't.

## Quick Start (For Bobb)

When building an agent with a user:

1. **Identify agent type** - What role does this agent play?
2. **Consult the type guide** - Review binary decision checklist
3. **Make YES/NO choices** - Select components that fit
4. **Copy selected components** - Build the persona foundation
5. **Add domain expertise** - Incorporate user's specialized knowledge
6. **Add personality** - Give the agent its unique character

The components handle proven basics. You handle the unique parts.

## Component Philosophy

**What Components ARE**:
- Proven instruction patterns for common needs
- Quality-assured building blocks
- Starting points for customization
- Knowledge captured from successful agents

**What Components are NOT**:
- Rigid templates that can't be modified
- Replacements for thoughtful design
- One-size-fits-all solutions

Components ensure **nothing critical gets missed** while giving you flexibility to customize for specific needs.
