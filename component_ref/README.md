# Agent Component Reference Library

**Proven instruction patterns for Agent C builders**

âœ… **Phase 1 Validated**: 75-85% time savings, production-ready

---

## What This Is

The Component Reference Library captures proven instruction patterns for building agents. Instead of starting from scratch, use validated components as building blocks.

**Key Results from Phase 1**:
- 3 pilot agents built and validated
- 75-85% faster than building from scratch
- 100% success rate (27/27 criteria met)
- Zero component conflicts

---

## The Binary Decision Model

Make simple YES/NO choices when building agents:

```
Does this agent access workspaces?
â†’ YES: Use Critical Interaction Guidelines
â†’ NO:  Skip it

Does this agent need ThinkTools?
â†’ YES: Use Reflection Rules
â†’ NO:  Skip it

Does this agent write Python code?
â†’ YES: Use Code Quality - Python
â†’ NO:  Skip it
```

No complex tiers or conditional logic. Each component either fits your needs or doesn't.

## Quick Start

1. **Choose your agent type** from [02_agent_type_guides](./02_agent_type_guides/)
2. **Make binary decisions** for each component (YES/NO)
3. **Copy selected components** into your agent persona
4. **Customize** for your specific needs
5. **Add your domain expertise** and personality

---

## Component Philosophy

**What Components ARE**:
- Proven instruction patterns
- Starting points for customization
- Knowledge capture from real deployments

**What Components are NOT**:
- Rigid templates
- Replacements for thoughtful design
- One-size-fits-all solutions

Components handle proven basics so you can focus on unique domain expertise and personality.

## Phase 2 Roadmap

**Planned Components**:
- Planning Coordination
- Clone Delegation
- Team Collaboration

**Planned Guides**:
- Orchestrator Agent Guide
- Specialist Agent Guide
- Multi-Agent Team Guide
