## Selected Pilot Agents (3 Total)

### Pilot 1: Documentation Organizer
**Type**: Simple Domo Agent - General Purpose  
**Purpose**: Documentation and workspace organization specialist

**Components Used**:
- ✅ Critical Interaction Guidelines
- ✅ Reflection Rules
- ✅ Workspace Organization
- ❌ Code Quality components (not applicable)

**Success Criteria**:
- Successfully creates organized folder structures
- Safe path verification working
- Uses think tool for planning
- Maintains .scratch directory
- No invalid path operations

**Estimated Time**: 2-3 hours (vs. 6-8 hours from scratch = 60-70% savings)

### Pilot 3: TypeScript/JavaScript Development Specialist
**Type**: Development-Focused Domo Agent  
**Purpose**: TypeScript/JavaScript specialist for modern web applications

**Components Used**:
- ✅ Critical Interaction Guidelines
- ✅ Reflection Rules
- ✅ Workspace Organization
- ✅ Code Quality - TypeScript
- ❌ Other language code quality

**Success Criteria**:
- Produces type-safe TypeScript code
- Modern JavaScript/TypeScript practices
- Proper modern project structure
- TypeScript compiler strict mode compliance
- Language variant flexibility validation

**Estimated Time**: 3-4 hours (vs. 14-18 hours from scratch = 75-80% savings)

## Component Coverage Matrix

| Component | Pilot 1 | Pilot 2 | Pilot 3 | Coverage |
|-----------|---------|---------|---------|----------|
| Critical Interaction Guidelines | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | 100% |
| Reflection Rules | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | 100% |
| Workspace Organization | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | 100% |
| Code Quality - Python | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ | 33% |
| Code Quality - C# | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | **0%** |
| Code Quality - TypeScript | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | 33% |

**Note**: C# Code Quality component NOT tested in Phase 1 validation. Consider quick follow-up validation or Phase 2 inclusion.

## Validation Strategy

**Complexity Progression**:
1. Simple (3 components, non-technical)
2. Moderate (4 components, single-language development)
3. Moderate+ (4 components, language variant validation)

**Key Validation Questions**:
- **Pilot 1**: Are binary decisions clear for non-coding agents?
- **Pilot 2**: Do Code Quality components integrate smoothly?
- **Pilot 3**: Does TypeScript component match Python quality/depth?

**Expected Outcomes**:
- 60-80% time savings validated
- Clear documentation of pain points
- Component refinements identified
- Real examples for library
