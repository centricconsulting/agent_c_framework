# Phase 2 Planning
## Agent Component Reference Library - Tier 2 Components

**Date**: January 10, 2025  
**Status**: PLANNING  
**Phase 1 Completion**: ‚úÖ APPROVED FOR PRODUCTION

---

## Executive Summary

Phase 2 focuses on validating **Tier 2 components** - more advanced patterns for orchestration, planning, clone delegation, and multi-agent coordination. Building on Phase 1's proven methodology and success, Phase 2 will validate components that enable complex agent workflows and team-based approaches.

**Phase 1 Foundation**:
- ‚úÖ 6 Tier 1 components production-ready
- ‚úÖ Binary decision model validated (10/10 clarity)
- ‚úÖ 75-85% time savings proven
- ‚úÖ Component independence confirmed
- ‚úÖ Language modularity validated

**Phase 2 Scope**: 3-4 Tier 2 components + 2-3 additional agent type guides

---

## Tier 2 Components to Validate

**FINALIZED: 3 Components (Human Pairing Component removed - redundant with Domo guide)**

### 1. Planning Coordination Component

**Purpose**: Patterns for agents that use workspace planning tools to manage complex multi-step workflows

**Key Content**:
- When to create plans vs ad-hoc work
- Task breakdown best practices
- Progress tracking and state management
- Plan-driven delegation patterns
- Quality gates and completion signoffs

**Binary Decision**: "Does this agent coordinate multi-step workflows with planning tools?"

**Target Agents**: Orchestrators, project coordinators, workflow managers

**Complexity**: Medium-High (integration with planning tools)

---

### 2. Clone Delegation Component

**Purpose**: Patterns for agents that delegate work to clones effectively

**Key Content**:
- Single-focused task design (15-30 min tasks)
- Context burnout prevention
- Recovery and resumability patterns
- Metadata vs status tracking
- Handoff documentation

**Binary Decision**: "Does this agent delegate tasks to clones?"

**Target Agents**: Orchestrators, team leads, workflow coordinators

**Complexity**: High (requires understanding multi-agent patterns)

---

### 3. Team Collaboration Component

**Purpose**: Patterns for agents working in multi-agent teams

**Key Content**:
- Direct specialist communication vs orchestrator routing
- Role boundaries and escalation paths
- Team coordination protocols
- AgentTeamTools usage patterns

**Binary Decision**: "Does this agent collaborate with other specialist agents?"

**Target Agents**: Specialists in mesh teams, orchestrators managing teams

**Complexity**: High (multi-agent coordination)

---

### 4. Human Pairing Component

**Status**: ‚ùå REMOVED - Redundant with Domo Agent Guide

**Decision Rationale**: Human interaction patterns are already comprehensively covered by the Domo Agent Guide. The proposed Human Pairing Component content overlapped significantly with existing domo guidance. Rather than fragmenting human interaction patterns, we're keeping them consolidated in the domo guide.

**Alternative Approach**: If specific human collaboration patterns are needed (e.g., pair programming), create specialized agent type guides as variants rather than components.

---

---

### 2. Specialist Agent Guide

**Purpose**: Building domain expert agents that work in teams

- Role distribution and responsibilities
- Communication flows
- Quality gates between agents

**Not a single agent guide** - patterns for designing agent teams

---

## Phase 2 Validation Methodology

Following Phase 1's proven approach:

### Pilot Agent Selection

Build **3 pilot agents** representing different Tier 2 use cases:

**Pilot #1**: Simple Orchestrator  
- Uses Planning Coordination + Clone Delegation
- Manages straightforward multi-step workflow
- Tests planning + delegation patterns
- **Est. build time**: 90-120 minutes

**Pilot #2**: Development Orchestrator  
- Uses Planning + Clone Delegation + Code Quality
- Coordinates development work across clones
- Tests Tier 1 + Tier 2 integration
- **Est. build time**: 120-150 minutes

**Pilot #3**: Specialist Team Member  
- Uses Team Collaboration + domain expertise
- Works in direct communication mesh
- Tests team coordination patterns
- **Est. build time**: 90-120 minutes

---

### Success Criteria per Pilot

Each pilot agent must demonstrate:

**Planning Coordination** (if used):
- Creates well-structured plans
- Tasks are appropriately sized
- Uses quality gates effectively
- Tracks progress meaningfully
- Plan-driven workflow clear

**Clone Delegation** (if used):
- Tasks are single-focused (not sequences)
- Context-bounded (15-30 min max)
- Resumable after failures
- Clear handoff documentation
- Metadata captures value

**Team Collaboration** (if used):
- Clear role boundaries
- Effective specialist communication
- Appropriate escalation
- No "telephone game" issues

**Integration Quality**:
- No conflicts with Tier 1 components
- No overlaps or gaps
- Synergy with foundation components

---

### Validation Tracking

Use same proven template from Phase 1:
- Binary component decisions (YES/NO)
- Build time tracking
- Component quality assessment
- Integration validation
- Success criteria verification
- Lessons learned capture

**Target Metrics**:
- Time savings: ‚â•50% (Tier 2 components more complex)
- Success rate: ‚â•80%
- Binary clarity: ‚â•8/10
- Integration quality: Zero conflicts

## Key Differences from Phase 1

### Higher Complexity

**Tier 1** (Phase 1):
- Foundation components
- Single-agent patterns
- Mostly language-agnostic
- Straightforward binary decisions

**Tier 2** (Phase 2):
- Advanced coordination patterns
- Multi-agent interactions
- Workflow management
- More nuanced binary decisions

### Longer Build Times

**Phase 1 Average**: 56 minutes per pilot  
**Phase 2 Estimate**: 90-120 minutes per pilot

**Why longer**:
- More components per agent (5-7 vs 3-4)
- More complex workflows to design
- Multi-agent coordination considerations
- Planning and delegation overhead

### Different Success Metrics

**Time Savings Target**: 50-60% (vs 60-80% in Phase 1)
- Tier 2 components add more value but also more complexity
- Still substantial savings, but expectation adjustment

**Complexity Focus**: Validating orchestration patterns
- Not just "does it work" but "does it scale"
- Recovery and resumability critical
- Team dynamics validation

## Open Questions

### Component Scope

**Q**: Should Human Pairing be Tier 2 or separate validation?  
**A**: TBD - Could defer to Phase 3 if pilots don't require it

**Q**: Are 4 Tier 2 components too many for one phase?  
**A**: May reduce to 3 core (Planning, Delegation, Team) and defer Human Pairing

### Pilot Agent Selection

**Q**: Should we test Hub-and-Spoke vs Direct Mesh team patterns?  
**A**: Pilot #3 could test Direct Mesh; Hub-and-Spoke naturally tested via Pilots #1-2

**Q**: Do we need a non-orchestrator agent using Planning tools?  
**A**: Possibly - some specialist agents manage their own complex workflows

### Validation Depth

**Q**: Should we test multi-clone delegation at scale?  
**A**: Keep pilots realistic (2-3 clones max); scale testing can be Phase 3

**Q**: How thoroughly should we test recovery/resumability?  
**A**: Include as success criteria, but don't deliberately break things excessively

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions

1. **Review this plan** with stakeholders
2. **Finalize Tier 2 component list** (3 or 4 components?)
3. **Draft Tier 2 component documents** (Planning, Delegation, Team)

## Conclusion

Phase 2 builds on Phase 1's solid foundation to validate advanced orchestration and team coordination patterns. Using the same rigorous methodology that delivered 75-85% time savings in Phase 1, we'll validate Tier 2 components through 3 carefully selected pilot agents.

**Key Principles**:
- Same binary decision model
- Same validation methodology  
- Same quality standards
- Realistic complexity expectations
