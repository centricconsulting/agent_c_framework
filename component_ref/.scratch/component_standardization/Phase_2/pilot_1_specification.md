# Pilot #1 Specification: Simple Orchestrator

**Date**: January 10, 2025  
**Status**: READY TO BUILD  
**Pilot Type**: Simple Orchestrator (Planning + Clone Delegation)

---

## Agent Purpose

**Name**: Document Workflow Coordinator

**Primary Role**: Orchestrate multi-step documentation workflows by creating plans, delegating tasks to clones, and validating outputs.

**Use Case**: A user needs to organize, analyze, and standardize a collection of technical documentation files. The orchestrator creates a plan, delegates analysis and organization tasks to clones, validates outputs, and produces a final organized documentation set.

**Why This Use Case**:
- Straightforward workflow (not overly complex)
- Clear planning needs (multiple steps, state tracking)
- Natural delegation points (file analysis, organization)
- Easy to validate success (documentation organized correctly)
- Realistic orchestration scenario

---

## Required Capabilities

**Core Orchestration**:
- Create and manage plans using WorkspacePlanningTools
- Delegate focused tasks to clones
- Track progress and maintain state
- Validate clone deliverables
- Coordinate sequential workflow phases

**Domain Focus**:
- Documentation organization and standardization
- Content analysis and categorization
- File management and restructuring
- Quality validation

**Tools Needed**:
- WorkspaceTools (file management)
- WorkspacePlanningTools (workflow coordination)
- ThinkTools (analysis and decision-making)
- Agent clone access (act_chat, act_oneshot)

## Binary Component Decisions

### Tier 1 Components

**1. Critical Interaction Guidelines**
- **Question**: Does this agent access workspaces or file paths?
- **Decision**: ✅ YES
- **Rationale**: Agent manages documentation files in workspace

**2. Reflection Rules**
- **Question**: Does this agent have access to ThinkTools?
- **Decision**: ✅ YES
- **Rationale**: Agent needs systematic thinking for workflow planning and analysis

**3. Workspace Organization**
- **Question**: Does this agent use workspace tools for file and directory management?
- **Decision**: ✅ YES
- **Rationale**: Agent organizes documentation files and manages workspace structure

**4. Code Quality Standards**
- **Question**: Does this agent write or modify code?
- **Decision**: ❌ NO
- **Rationale**: Documentation focus, not a coding agent

### Tier 2 Components

**5. Planning Coordination**
- **Question**: Does this agent coordinate multi-step workflows using planning tools?
- **Decision**: ✅ YES
- **Rationale**: Multi-step documentation workflow requires planning and state tracking

**6. Clone Delegation**
- **Question**: Does this agent delegate tasks to clones?
- **Decision**: ✅ YES
- **Rationale**: Delegates file analysis and organization tasks to clones

**7. Team Collaboration**
- **Question**: Does this agent collaborate with other specialist agents in a team?
- **Decision**: ❌ NO
- **Rationale**: Works solo with clones, not part of multi-agent specialist team

## Success Criteria

Each criterion rated on 10-point scale (1-10):

### Planning Coordination Criteria

**1. Plan Creation Effectiveness**
- Agent creates well-structured plan with clear objectives
- Tasks are logically sequenced and hierarchically organized
- Context fields provide "how to" guidance, not just "what"

**2. Task Breakdown Quality**
- Tasks are single-focused (one deliverable per task)
- Tasks are time-bounded (reasonable completion timeframes)
- Clear success criteria for each task

**3. Quality Gates Implementation**
- Uses `requires_completion_signoff` for critical validation points
- Validates clone deliverables before proceeding
- Completion reports capture key outcomes

### Clone Delegation Criteria

**4. Clone Task Design**
- Tasks follow single-focused principle (no sequences)
- Tasks are context-complete (15-30 min ideal)
- Clear process context provided to clones

**5. Session Management**
- Appropriate use of new clone sessions vs. continuations
- Session IDs tracked for work continuity
- Fresh context used effectively

**6. Recovery and Resumability**
- Tasks are resumable if interrupted
- Partial work preserved appropriately
- Planning state updated continuously

### Integration Quality Criteria

**7. Tier 1 + Tier 2 Integration**
- No conflicts between components
- Components work together seamlessly
- Workspace, reflection, and planning patterns harmonize

**8. Component Usage Fidelity**
- Components used verbatim or with minimal customization
- No contradictions to component guidance
- Proper component ordering in persona structure

### Workflow Effectiveness Criteria

**9. Workflow Execution**
- Successfully completes documentation organization workflow
- Maintains state across multiple steps
- Produces quality outputs meeting requirements

**10. Builder Experience**
- Binary component decisions were clear (no ambiguity)
- Component guidance was sufficient
- Build process was smooth and efficient

## Time Savings Estimate

**From-Scratch Estimate**: 4-5 hours
- Understanding planning tool patterns: 60-90 min
- Designing delegation approach: 45-60 min
- Crafting clone task patterns: 45-60 min
- Defining workflow structure: 30-45 min
- Writing domain expertise: 30-45 min
- Testing and refinement: 30-45 min

**With Components Estimate**: 90-120 minutes
- Binary component decisions: 5 min (5 components × ~1 min each)
- Copying components: 10-15 min
- Workspace placeholder customization: 5 min
- Adding domain expertise: 30-45 min
- Adding personality: 15-20 min
- Testing and refinement: 25-30 min

**Target Time Savings**: 50-60% (aligned with Phase 2 expectations)

## Validation Tracking Approach

### Build Time Tracking
- Start time and end time
- Time per component decision
- Time per component integration
- Time for domain customization
- Time for testing

### Component Quality Assessment
- Rate each component 1-10
- Document any issues or ambiguities
- Note integration quality
- Identify improvement opportunities

### Success Criteria Validation
- Test each of 10 criteria
- Rate 1-10 with evidence
- Document failures or partial success
- Overall success rate calculation

### Lessons Learned
- What worked exceptionally well
- What was confusing or difficult
- Component improvements needed
- Process improvements identified

## Deliverables

1. **Agent YAML File**: `document_workflow_coordinator.yaml` in appropriate location
2. **Validation Tracking**: `pilot_1_validation_tracking.md` with complete tracking data
3. **Test Results**: Evidence of success criteria testing
4. **Example Workspace**: Sample documentation workflow execution (optional but recommended)

## Key Validation Focus Areas

**For Phase 2 Specifically**:
1. **Planning Patterns Work**: Verify planning coordination patterns are clear and effective
2. **Delegation Patterns Work**: Verify clone delegation patterns prevent common pitfalls
3. **Integration Quality**: Confirm Tier 1 + Tier 2 components integrate seamlessly
4. **Time Savings**: Validate 50-60% target is achievable
5. **Binary Clarity**: Confirm component decisions are unambiguous

**Comparison to Phase 1**:
- Phase 1 averaged 56 min, Phase 2 targets 90-120 min (acceptable increase)
- Phase 1 achieved 10/10 binary clarity, Phase 2 targets ≥8/10
- Phase 1 achieved 100% success, Phase 2 targets ≥80%

## Notes

- Keep it simple - don't over-engineer the orchestrator
- Focus on validating Tier 2 components specifically
- Document everything for analysis
- Be honest about issues or difficulties
- This is a validation pilot, not production agent

**Status**: Specification complete, ready to proceed with build phase
