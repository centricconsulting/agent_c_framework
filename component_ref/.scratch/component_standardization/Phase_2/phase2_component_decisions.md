# Phase 2 Component Decisions

**Date**: January 10, 2025  
**Status**: COMPONENTS FINALIZED

---

## Final Tier 2 Component List

### 1. ✅ Planning Coordination Component
**Status**: COMPLETE  
**Location**: `//components/01_core_components/planning_coordination_component.md`

**Binary Decision**: "Does this agent coordinate multi-step workflows using planning tools?"

**Key Patterns**:
- When to create plans vs ad-hoc work
- Task breakdown principles (single-focused, time-bounded)
- Context field usage ("how to" not just "what")
- Quality gates and completion signoffs
- Progress tracking and state management
- Recovery and resumability

---

### 2. ✅ Clone Delegation Component
**Status**: COMPLETE  
**Location**: `//components/01_core_components/clone_delegation_component.md`

**Binary Decision**: "Does this agent delegate tasks to clones?"

**Key Patterns**:
- Single-focused task design (THE GOLDEN RULE)
- Task sequences: the fatal anti-pattern
- Context window discipline (15-30 min tasks)
- Session management
- Recovery protocols
- Metadata capture (value, not status)
- Clone vs specialist delegation distinction

---

### 3. ✅ Team Collaboration Component
**Status**: COMPLETE  
**Location**: `//components/01_core_components/team_collaboration_component.md`

**Binary Decision**: "Does this agent collaborate with other specialist agents in a team?"

**Key Patterns**:
- Team architecture patterns (Sequential, Hub-and-Spoke, Direct Mesh)
- Direct specialist communication via AgentTeamTools
- Role boundaries (orchestrator vs specialist)
- Escalation paths
- Team configuration requirements
- Communication protocols

---

## Rejected Component: Human Pairing

### Decision: NOT PROCEEDING

**Rationale**: 
- Human interaction patterns already comprehensively covered by Domo Agent Guide
- Proposed "Human Pairing Component" content was redundant with existing domo guide
- No distinct, reusable pattern that merited separate component
- Better to keep domo guide comprehensive rather than fragment human interaction patterns

**What Domo Already Covers**:
- Direct user interaction and collaboration
- Conversational interfaces
- User-facing communication standards
- Professional, approachable personality
- Collaborative problem-solving approach

**Alternative Approach**:
If specific human collaboration patterns are needed (e.g., pair programming), create specialized **agent type guides** as variants (like "Pair Programming Domo Guide") rather than components.

## Phase 2 Component Count: 3 Tier 2 Components

This is appropriate because:
1. **Quality over Quantity**: Three solid, well-defined components better than forcing a fourth
2. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Planning, delegation, and team patterns cover advanced orchestration needs
3. **Clear Boundaries**: Each component addresses distinct coordination patterns
4. **Integration Ready**: All three integrate well with Tier 1 foundation components

## Component Integration Map

### How Tier 2 Components Work Together

**Orchestrator Agent Pattern**:
```
Tier 1 Foundation:
- Critical Interaction Guidelines (workspace safety)
- Reflection Rules (systematic thinking)
- Workspace Organization (file management)

Tier 2 Coordination:
- Planning Coordination (workflow structure)
- Clone Delegation (execution patterns)
- Team Collaboration (specialist coordination)
```

**Specialist Agent Pattern**:
```
Tier 1 Foundation:
- Critical Interaction Guidelines (workspace safety)
- Reflection Rules (systematic thinking)
- Workspace Organization (file management)
- Code Quality variant (if applicable)

Tier 2 Coordination:
- Team Collaboration (peer and orchestrator communication)
```

**Integration Benefits**:
- Planning provides structure for delegation
- Delegation leverages planning for state tracking
- Team collaboration uses planning for coordination
- All three rely on Tier 1 foundation

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions

1. ✅ **Component Creation**: All 3 components drafted
2. ⏳ **Pilot Agent Selection**: Define 3 pilot agents to validate Tier 2 components
3. ⏳ **Success Criteria**: Define specific validation criteria per pilot
4. ⏳ **Build Pilots**: Execute pilot builds using Tier 2 components
5. ⏳ **Validation Analysis**: Analyze results and refine components

### Pilot Agent Recommendations

**Pilot #1: Simple Orchestrator**
- Components: Planning + Clone Delegation (+ Tier 1 foundation)
- Purpose: Validate planning and delegation patterns
- Complexity: Medium

**Pilot #2: Development Orchestrator**  
- Components: Planning + Clone Delegation + Code Quality (+ Tier 1 foundation)
- Purpose: Validate Tier 1 + Tier 2 integration for development work
- Complexity: High

**Pilot #3: Specialist Team Member**
- Components: Team Collaboration (+ Tier 1 foundation + domain)
- Purpose: Validate team patterns from specialist perspective
- Complexity: Medium-High

---

## Component Quality Goals

### Validation Targets (Adjusted from Phase 1)

**Time Savings**: 50-60% (vs 75-85% in Phase 1)
- Tier 2 components more complex but still substantial savings

**Success Rate**: ≥80% (vs 100% in Phase 1)
- Higher complexity may reveal edge cases

**Binary Clarity**: ≥8/10 (vs 10/10 in Phase 1)
- More nuanced decisions but still clear

**Integration Quality**: Zero conflicts (same as Phase 1)
- Tier 2 must integrate cleanly with Tier 1

### Success Criteria

✅ **Component Quality**: All 3 components rated ≥8/10  
✅ **Integration**: Zero conflicts with Tier 1 components  
✅ **Time Savings**: ≥50% vs building orchestrators from scratch  
✅ **Coverage**: Planning, delegation, and team patterns validated  
✅ **Reusability**: Components used with minimal customization

**Status**: Ready to proceed with pilot agent building  
**Component Count**: 3 Tier 2 Components (Finalized)  
**Next Phase**: Pilot validation
