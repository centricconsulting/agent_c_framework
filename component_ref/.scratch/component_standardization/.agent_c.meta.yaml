      3-5 pilot agents using only the existing reference components. Document time
      savings, pain points, and learnings to refine components before expanding to

      Success Criteria:

      - Build 3-5 agents of different types using component references

      - Document build time and compare to typical agent creation time

      - Identify component gaps, unclear guidance, or usability issues

      - Capture real composition examples for the examples library

      - Document lessons learned in evolution tracking

      - Refine Tier 1 components based on validation feedback'
