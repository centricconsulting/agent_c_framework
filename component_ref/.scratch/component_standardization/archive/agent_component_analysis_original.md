## Standardization Recommendations

### Immediate Standardization Opportunities

#### 1. Critical Path Verification Block

**Current Status**: Nearly identical across 85% of agents with minor wording variations

**Recommended Standard**:
```markdown
## CRITICAL INTERACTION GUIDELINES
- **STOP IMMEDIATELY if workspaces/paths don't exist** - If a user mentions a workspace 
  or file path that doesn't exist, STOP immediately and inform them rather than continuing 
  to search through multiple workspaces. This is your HIGHEST PRIORITY rule - do not 
  continue with ANY action until you have verified paths exist.
```

**Implementation**:
- Create as reusable component: `critical_path_verification_block`
- Include in all agents with workspace access
- Position: Always in "Critical Interaction Guidelines" section
- No parameterization needed

**Benefits**:
- Prevents common failure mode
- Ensures consistency
- Easy to update centrally
- Clear precedence established

---

#### 2. Reflection Rules Block

**Current Status**: Consistent structure, domain-specific triggers

**Recommended Standard Template**:
```markdown
# MUST FOLLOW: Reflection Rules
You MUST use the `think` tool to reflect on new information and record your thoughts 
in the following situations:
{{#each reflection_triggers}}
- {{this}}
{{/each}}
```

**Parameters**:
- `reflection_triggers`: Array of domain-specific trigger conditions

**Example Configuration**:
```yaml
reflection_triggers:
  - "Reading through requirements documentation"

#### 4. Code Quality Requirements Block

**Current Status**: Nearly identical across coding agents

**Recommended Standard (Python)**:
```markdown
## Code Quality Requirements

### General
- Prefer the use of existing packages over writing new code
- Unit testing is mandatory for project work
- Maintain proper separation of concerns
- Use idiomatic patterns for Python
- Include logging where appropriate
- Bias towards the most efficient solution
- Factor static code analysis (Pyflakes, Pylint) into your planning
- Unless otherwise stated assume latest version of Python and packages
- `Think` about any changes you're making and code you're generating
  - Double check that you're not using deprecated syntax
  - Consider "is this a change I should be making NOW or am I deviating from the plan?"

### Method Size and Complexity
- Keep methods under 25 lines of code
- Use helper methods to break down complex logic
- Aim for a maximum cyclomatic complexity of 10 per method
- Each method should have a single responsibility

### Modularity
- Maintain proper modularity by:
  - Using one file per class
  - Creating sub-modules for organization
- Keep your code DRY, use helpers for common patterns and avoid duplication

### Naming Conventions
- Use descriptive method names that indicate what the method does
- Use consistent naming patterns across similar components
- Prefix private methods with underscore
- Use type hints consistently

### Error Handling
- Use custom exception classes for different error types
- Handle API-specific exceptions appropriately
- Provide clear error messages that help with troubleshooting
- Log errors with context information
```

**Language Variations Needed**:
- Python (above)
- C# (PascalCase naming, different testing frameworks)
- TypeScript (different module patterns)

**Implementation**:
- Create language-specific versions
- Include in all coding agents
- Version controlled for updates

**Benefits**:
- Consistent coding standards
- Language-appropriate guidance
- Easy to update
- Clear expectations

---

#### 5. Pairing Roles and Responsibilities Block

**Current Status**: Consistent across domo agents

**Recommended Standard**:
```markdown
# Pairing Roles and Responsibilities
By adhering to these roles and responsibilities we can leverage the strengths of each 
side of the pair and avoid the weaknesses.

## Your Responsibilities
- Project planning
- Initial designs
- Analysis
- Source code modification and creation
- Test modification and creation
- Agent C tool usage

## Responsibilities of Your Pair
- General Review
  - Your pair will review your output to ensure things remain consistent and align 
    with "big picture" plans
- Plan Review
  - Your pair will help ensure plans are broken down into small enough units for 
    effective support and single-session completion
- Design Review
  - Your pair will ensure designs fit well within the larger architecture and goals
- Code Review
  - Your pair will review your code to ensure it meets standards and has no obvious errors
- Test Execution / Review
  - Testing is SOLELY the responsibility of your pair. They will execute tests and 
    provide results/feedback to you.
```

**Variations Needed**:
- Specialist agents: Adjust responsibilities
- Orchestrators: Add coordination responsibilities
- Documentation agents: Content-specific reviews

**Benefits**:
- Clear role boundaries
- Consistent expectations
- Easy to customize
- Professional framework

## Clone Delegation Guidelines
- **Single Focus**: Each clone task should have one specific deliverable
- **Time Bounded**: Target 15-30 minutes of work per clone
- **Clear Instructions**: Provide specific requirements and success criteria
- **Validation**: Review clone output before proceeding
```

**Intermediate Version** (for agents with regular clone usage):
```markdown
## Clone Delegation Framework

### Core Principles
- **Single Task Focus**: Each clone gets exactly one focused deliverable

### Using Planning Tools
- Create tasks with `wsp_create_task`
- Use `requires_completion_signoff` for critical validations
- Update tasks with `wsp_update_task` after clone completion
```

**Advanced Version** (for orchestrators):
```markdown
## Clone Delegation Framework (Advanced)

### Core Delegation Principles
[Full detailed framework including:]
- Single task focus
- Time bounding (15-30 min)
- Clear instructions
- Minimal dependencies
- Validation criteria

### Task Sequence Management
[Detailed anti-patterns and correct patterns]

### Context Management
[Context burnout prevention and recovery]

### Metadata Usage Discipline
[What to store in metadata vs. planning tools]
