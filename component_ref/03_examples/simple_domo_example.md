# Simple Domo Agent Example - Documentation Organizer

## Overview

- **Agent Purpose**: Documentation and workspace organization specialist for non-technical users
- **Agent Type**: Simple Domo Agent - General Purpose
- **Complexity**: Simple (non-coding)
- **Components Used**: 3 of 6 Tier 1 components
- **Build Time**: 53 minutes
- **Time Savings**: 70-88% faster than building from scratch (6-8 hours → under 1 hour)

## Use Case

**When to build an agent like this:**

You need an agent that helps users organize files, manage workspace structures, and maintain clean documentation hierarchies. The agent should work with non-technical users who need clear guidance and assistance with file organization without any programming capabilities.

**Problems this agent solves:**

- **Document Chaos**: Files scattered across directories without logical organization
- **Workspace Clutter**: Temporary files, outdated content, and unclear structures
- **Knowledge Management**: Difficulty finding documents and maintaining shared resources
- **Non-Technical Users**: People who need organization help but aren't developers

**Example scenarios:**

- "Help me organize these project documents"
- "Create a folder structure for my research notes"
- "Find and categorize all my markdown files"
- "Clean up duplicate files in this workspace"

## Binary Decision Walkthrough

### Component Selection Process

The component library uses a **binary decision model** - simple YES/NO questions that eliminate ambiguity and make component selection fast and clear.

| Component | Decision | Rationale | Decision Time |
|-----------|----------|-----------|---------------|
| **Critical Interaction Guidelines** | ✅ **YES** | Agent creates folders, moves files, and verifies paths - workspace access is fundamental to its role. Binary question: "Does this agent access workspaces or file paths?" = **YES** | ~1 minute |
| **Reflection Rules** | ✅ **YES** | Agent needs to plan organization strategies, think through file structures, and analyze existing directories before reorganizing. Binary question: "Does agent have ThinkTools?" = **YES** | ~1 minute |
| **Workspace Organization** | ✅ **YES** | This IS the core component - workspace organization is literally the agent's purpose. Provides all standards for file operations, scratchpad usage, trash management. Binary question: "Does agent use workspace tools for file management?" = **YES** | ~30 seconds |
| **Code Quality - Python** | ❌ **NO** | Explicitly a non-coding agent for non-technical users. No Python development. Binary question: "Writes/modifies Python code?" = **NO** | ~15 seconds |
| **Code Quality - C#** | ❌ **NO** | Not a coding agent, no C# development. Binary question: "Writes/modifies C# code?" = **NO** | ~10 seconds |
| **Code Quality - TypeScript** | ❌ **NO** | Not a coding agent, no TypeScript development. Binary question: "Writes/modifies TypeScript code?" = **NO** | ~10 seconds |

**Total Decision Time**: 3 minutes  
**Component Count**: 3 of 6 components selected

### Decision-Making Insights

**What made decisions fast:**
- Binary YES/NO questions were crystal clear
- No "maybe" scenarios or ambiguity
- Agent purpose directly mapped to component questions
- No analysis paralysis - every decision was obvious

**Pattern observed:**
- Foundational components (Critical, Reflection, Workspace): ~1 minute each to consider
- Language-specific components (Code Quality): ~10-15 seconds each (instant NO for non-coding agent)

---

## Build Process

### Phase 1: Component Selection (3 minutes)

Fast and frictionless binary decisions using clear YES/NO questions. Every component had an obvious answer based on the agent's purpose (file organization for non-technical users).

**Key insight**: The binary decision model eliminated the typical "what should I include?" analysis paralysis.

### Phase 2: Component Copy & Review (8 minutes)

- Read all three selected component files
- Reviewed component patterns and usage notes
- Noted customization points (workspace name placeholder)

**Components were ready-to-use** - comprehensive instructions that could be copied verbatim into the agent persona.

**Pain point identified**: Workspace Organization component had {workspace} placeholder with unclear guidance on whether to use specific name or generic language. **Resolution**: Chose generic approach ("the workspace assigned to you") for flexibility.

### Phase 3: Domain Customization (30 minutes)

**Core Persona Development** (20 minutes):
- Created agent identity and purpose statement
- Copied component patterns into persona structure
- Customized workspace placeholder with generic language
- Added domain expertise section for document organization strategies

**Domain Expertise Addition** (15 minutes):
- Added "Document Organization Expertise" section
- Defined organization strategies (assessment-first approach)
- Documented standard organization patterns (by project, date, topic, type)
- Added file management best practices
- Included collaboration support guidance

**What this phase involved:**
This is where you add what makes the agent unique. Components provide the foundation (safety, thinking, workspace standards), but you build the specialized knowledge:
- Organization strategies and patterns
- File naming conventions
- Maintenance and cleanup approaches
- Collaboration standards

### Phase 4: Personality & Finalization (15 minutes)

**Personality & Communication Style** (10 minutes):
- Created "Your Approach to Helping Users" section
- Defined communication style (friendly, systematic, user-focused)
- Documented workflow pattern (7-step process: Understand → Analyze → Verify → Propose → Execute → Document → Confirm)
- Added boundaries ("What You Don't Do" section)
- Created "Core Values" summary

**YAML Structure Creation** (5 minutes):
- Created proper YAML structure with correct field order
- Added agent metadata (key, name, description)
- Configured tools (ThinkTools, WorkspaceTools)
- Set agent_params and categories
- Placed persona as LAST field (per Agent C specification)

**Total Build Time**: 53 minutes (under 1 hour!)

## Component Integration Example

Here's how the three components integrate seamlessly in the final persona:

```markdown
## CRITICAL INTERACTION GUIDELINES
- **STOP IMMEDIATELY if workspaces/paths don't exist** If a user mentions a workspace 
  or file path that doesn't exist, STOP immediately and inform them rather than continuing 
  to search through multiple workspaces. This is your HIGHEST PRIORITY rule - do not 
  continue with ANY action until you have verified paths exist.
- **PATH VERIFICATION**: VERIFY all paths exist before ANY operation. If a path doesn't 
  exist, STOP and notify the user
- **No Silent Failures**: Never assume a path exists without verification. Always confirm 
  access before proceeding with workspace operations.

# MUST FOLLOW: Reflection Rules
You MUST use the `think` tool to reflect on new information and record your thoughts in 
the following situations:
- Reading through unfamiliar code
- Reading plans from the planning tool
- Planning a complex refactoring or enhancement
- Analyzing potential bugs and their root causes
- After reading scratchpad content
- When considering possible solutions to a problem
- When evaluating the impact of a proposed change
- When determining the root cause of an issue
- If you find yourself wanting to immediately fix something

## Workspace Organization Guidelines

### Core Workspace Structure
- **Primary Workspace**: Use the workspace assigned to you for all operations unless 
  otherwise specified
- **Long-term Storage**: Use workspace for persistent files, documentation, and knowledge 
  repositories
- **User Collaboration**: Leverage workspace for shared resources and collaborative workflows
- **State Management**: Maintain operational state and progress tracking within workspace 
  structure

### Scratchpad Management
- **Working Area**: Utilize `.scratch` directory in your workspace as your primary working 
  and temporary storage area
- **Session Files**: Store temporary analysis, working notes, and processing files in 
  scratchpad
- **Handoff Notes**: Create unique handoff files (e.g., `step_1.2_handoff`, 
  `analysis_summary`) in scratchpad for workflow continuity
...
```

**Integration pattern**: Critical Guidelines (safety) → Reflection Rules (thinking) → Workspace Organization (operations) → Domain Expertise (specialized knowledge) → Personality (communication style)

**No conflicts, no overlaps** - each component has distinct purpose and they complement each other perfectly.

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well

**Binary Decision Model:**
- YES/NO questions eliminated all ambiguity
- Every decision took < 1 minute because criteria were crystal clear
- No "maybe" situations or analysis paralysis

**Component Quality:**
- Instruction text is well-written and comprehensive
- Components are truly ready to copy verbatim into personas
- No placeholder hell or complex customization required
- Clear that components reflect real-world testing

**Independent Components:**
- No dependencies or conflicts between components
- Each works standalone; combination works harmoniously
- Adding components doesn't increase complexity

**Time Savings:**
- Completed in under 1 hour vs. 6-8 hour estimate from scratch
- This is not theoretical - measurably faster
- Components provide proven patterns immediately

**Confidence in Quality:**
- Using validated components gives high confidence agent follows best practices
- No extensive testing iteration needed
- Foundation is solid from the start

### Challenges Encountered

**Workspace Placeholder Question** (Minor - 2 minutes):
- **Challenge**: Workspace Organization component had {workspace} placeholder without explicit guidance on whether to use specific name or generic language
- **Resolution**: Chose generic approach ("the workspace assigned to you") since agent should adapt to any workspace
- **Outcome**: Made agent more flexible and reusable across different projects

**Component Ordering** (Very Minor - 1 minute):
- **Challenge**: Had to infer logical ordering for components in persona (no explicit guidance)
- **Resolution**: Used intuitive order: Critical Guidelines → Reflection → Workspace Org (foundation to specialization)
- **Outcome**: Worked fine; would benefit from explicit example in documentation

**NOTE**: Both challenges were resolved in subsequent pilot builds with documentation improvements.

### Key Insights

1. **Build felt like "assembly" not "design from scratch"** - Assembling proven parts rather than inventing everything freed mental energy to focus on domain expertise and personality

2. **Domain expertise is where time investment should be** - Components provide foundation quickly (~15 minutes); time spent on customization (~30 minutes) is the value-add

3. **Binary model gets faster with experience** - First-time builders: ~3 min for decisions; experienced builders: ~2 min

4. **Quality comes from components** - Best practices encoded in components that would take hours of research to develop from scratch

---

## When to Use This Pattern

### Best for:

- **Non-technical user assistants** - Agents helping users with tasks that don't involve coding
- **File and document management** - Organization, cleanup, structure creation
- **Knowledge management** - Maintaining documentation libraries, research notes, project files
- **Workspace organization** - Any agent that primarily works with files and directories
- **Simple workflows** - Agents with clear, focused purposes that don't require extensive technical capabilities

### Not ideal for:

- **Development agents** - If agent writes code, add appropriate Code Quality component
- **Complex multi-step workflows** - Consider Planning component (Tier 2) for sophisticated task orchestration
- **Multi-agent coordination** - Use Orchestrator pattern with team composition
- **User-facing conversational agents** - Consider Human Pairing component for collaborative workflows

## Builder Tips

1. **Trust the binary model**: If you find yourself uncertain about a component, re-read the binary question. The answer should be obvious. If it's not obvious, the agent's purpose might need clarification first.

2. **Copy components verbatim first**: Don't customize components during the copy phase. Get them into your persona as-is, then identify customization needs. Usually you need very few changes (in this case, only 1 of 3 components).

3. **Spend time on domain expertise**: This is where your agent becomes unique. Components give you the foundation; domain expertise is your value-add. Budget 30-40% of build time here.

4. **Use the component ordering principle**: Foundation (Critical, Reflection) → Operational (Workspace, Code Quality) → Domain → Personality. This creates a logical flow that's easy to maintain.

5. **Generic is often better than specific**: When in doubt about placeholders (like {workspace}), choose generic language. Makes your agent more flexible and reusable.

6. **Personality matters**: Do not skip the communication style section. It's what makes your agent approachable and effective with users. Budget 10-15 minutes for this.

7. **Follow the YAML structure exactly**: Persona field LAST. This is a requirement in Agent C. Use the Domo Agent Guide as reference.
