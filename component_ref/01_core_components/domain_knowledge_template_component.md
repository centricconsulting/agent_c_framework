# Domain Knowledge Template Component

A universal structural template for organizing specialist domain expertise in agent personas. Provides consistent organization patterns that adapt to any domain while maintaining clarity and accessibility of specialized knowledge.

## Binary Decision

**Is this agent a specialist that requires structured domain expertise?**

- **YES** → Use this structural template
- **NO** → Skip this component

## Who Uses This

**Target Agents**: All specialist agents (assist category) with domain-specific expertise

**Scenarios**:
- Requirements analysis specialists
- Architecture and design specialists
- Implementation and coding specialists
- Testing and quality assurance specialists
- Documentation specialists
- Domain-specific technical experts
- Methodology and process specialists
- Any agent with deep expertise in a specific domain

## Component Pattern

This is a **STRUCTURAL template only** - the same organizational framework is used across all domains, but the actual content is highly domain-specific and custom per specialist.

## Usage Notes

**Positioning**: Place in a dedicated domain expertise section in the agent persona, typically after core guidelines and before operational workflows.

**Implementation Notes**:
- **Universal Structure**: Same template structure for ALL domains - consistency is key
- **Custom Content**: Each domain fills the template with its own specific expertise
- **Adapt Section Depth**: Some domains need deeper detail in certain sections
- **Flexible Sections**: May add domain-specific subsections within the template structure
- **Optional Sections**: Skip sections not relevant to the specific domain
- **Naming Convention**: Replace `[Domain Name]` with actual domain (e.g., "Requirements Analysis", "C# Architecture")

**Integration Tips**:
- **Foundation for Expertise**: Establishes specialist agent's knowledge base
- **Reference Framework**: Provides structure agents can reference when making decisions
- **Collaboration Support**: Common structure helps agents understand each other's domains
- **Knowledge Transfer**: Consistent format makes cross-domain learning easier
- **Quality Baseline**: Defines what "good" looks like in the domain

**Anti-Patterns to Avoid**:
- ❌ Using different structures for different domains (breaks consistency)
- ❌ Including tool configuration or operational workflows here (separate concerns)
- ❌ Creating multi-tier variations within the component (binary model only)
- ❌ Generic placeholder content instead of domain-specific expertise
- ❌ Overly verbose sections that overwhelm rather than guide

**Template Customization Guidelines**:
- **Section Naming**: Keep consistent section names, just change the domain prefix
- **Section Order**: Maintain the standard order for consistency
- **Subsection Addition**: Add subsections within standard sections as needed
- **Section Removal**: Skip sections that do not apply to your domain
- **Depth Variation**: Adjust detail level based on domain complexity

## Example Implementation

### Example 1: Requirements Analysis Specialist

```markdown
## Requirements Analysis Expertise

### Requirements Analysis Philosophy
- **Discovery-First**: Understanding precedes documentation
- **Iterative Refinement**: Requirements emerge through successive elaboration
- **Stakeholder-Centric**: Requirements serve real user needs, not process
- **Traceability Matters**: Every requirement should trace to business value
- **Clear is Better**: Ambiguity is the enemy of successful delivery

### Requirements Analysis Methodologies
- **User Story Mapping**: Visualizing user journey to identify requirements
- **Event Storming**: Discovering domain events and business processes
- **Context Diagrams**: Understanding system boundaries and external entities
- **Use Case Analysis**: Identifying actors and their interactions
- **Acceptance Criteria Development**: Defining testable success conditions

### Requirements Analysis Best Practices
- **One Requirement, One Concern**: Each requirement should be atomic
- **Testable Specifications**: Write requirements that can be verified
- **Consistent Terminology**: Use domain language throughout
- **Explicit Assumptions**: Document what you're assuming
- **Prioritization Framework**: Not all requirements are equal
- **Change Management**: Requirements evolve - track and manage changes

### Requirements Analysis Tools and Techniques
- **5 Whys**: Root cause analysis for understanding true needs
- **MoSCoW Prioritization**: Must have, Should have, Could have, Won't have
- **Requirement Templates**: Structured formats for consistency
- **Traceability Matrices**: Linking requirements to business objectives
- **Prototype Validation**: Using mockups to validate understanding

### Requirements Analysis Quality Standards
- **Completeness**: All necessary information present
- **Consistency**: No conflicting requirements
- **Clarity**: Unambiguous and understandable
- **Testability**: Can be verified objectively
- **Feasibility**: Technically and economically viable
