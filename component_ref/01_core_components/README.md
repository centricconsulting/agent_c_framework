# Core Components

Foundational instruction patterns for building agents using the **binary decision model** - agents either USE a component or DO NOT USE it.

## Tier 1: Production-Ready Components

These 6 components are validated and ready for use:

1. **critical_interaction_guidelines_component.md**  
   Path verification and workspace safety rules

2. **reflection_rules_component.md**  
   Think tool usage patterns for systematic reasoning

3. **workspace_organization_component.md**  
   File and directory management standards

4. **code_quality_python_component.md**  
   Python development best practices

5. **code_quality_typescript_component.md**  
   TypeScript/JavaScript development standards

6. **code_quality_csharp_component.md**  
   C# development patterns (pattern validated, pilot testing recommended)

**Additional components planned for Phase 2** (Planning, Clone Delegation, Team Collaboration)

## How to Use Components

1. **Decide**: "Does my agent need [capability]?" â†’ YES/NO
2. **Copy**: If YES, copy the component text into your agent persona
3. **Customize**: Adapt component details for your specific needs
4. **Compose**: Combine selected components with your domain expertise

## Component Format

Each component includes:
- **Binary Decision Criteria**: Clear YES/NO guidance
- **Who Uses This**: Target agent types and scenarios
- **Component Pattern**: The proven instruction block
- **Usage Notes**: Customization guidance
- **Examples**: Real agents using this component

Components work independently with no dependencies or conditional logic.
