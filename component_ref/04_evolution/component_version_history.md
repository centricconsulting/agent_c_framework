## Lessons for Future Components

### From Phase 1 Validation

1. **Placeholder guidance is essential**
   - Don't assume builders will infer usage
   - Two sentences can eliminate 100% of friction
   - Be explicit, not implicit

2. **Structural consistency enables patterns**
   - Code Quality components follow identical structure
   - Makes language variants predictable and learnable
   - Enables modularity and swappability

3. **Universal components are powerful**
   - Foundation components work across all agent types and languages
   - Don't create language-specific versions of universal patterns
   - Invest in making components truly universal

4. **Fast iteration on feedback works**
   - Identify issues immediately
   - Fix precisely and quickly
   - Validate in next pilot
   - Result: Rapid maturity

5. **Sometimes no changes is the right answer**
   - Pilots #2 & #3 had no changes
   - Absence of issues indicates maturity
   - Don't over-engineer or fix what isn't broken

---
