# ToolChest Redesign Implementation Tracker

This document tracks the implementation of the ToolChest redesign across multiple sessions. It will be updated as we progress through the implementation plan.

## Overview

The ToolChest redesign aims to properly separate available toolsets from active toolsets, allowing for more efficient management and initialization of toolsets.

## Implementation Tasks

### Phase 1: Core ToolChest Class Updates

| Add new attributes for tracking active and essential toolsets | Not Started | `__active_toolset_names`, `__essential_toolset_names` | |
| Update constructor to initialize new attributes | Not Started | | |
| Implement `activate_toolset` method | Not Started | | |
| Implement `deactivate_toolset` method | Not Started | | |
