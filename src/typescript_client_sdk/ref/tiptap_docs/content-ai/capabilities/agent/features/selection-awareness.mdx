Selection awareness allows the AI Agent to know the selected content in the editor. It helps the AI Agent understand the user's request and make precise edits to the selection only.

To activate selection awareness, set the `addSelection` option to `true`. This will send the selected content as [context](/content-ai/capabilities/agent/features/context) to the AI Agent.

```ts
provider.addUserMessage('Summarize the selected document', {
  addSelection: true, // Defaults to false
})
```
