The weather tool in `tools/weather/` demonstrates **all best practices**:

```
tools/weather/
├── tool.py                      # ✅ Clean 25-line interface
├── util/client.py              # ✅ Extended Weather class with business logic
└── tests/                      # ✅ Complete test suite
    ├── test_weather_component.py   # Component tests
    ├── test_weather_integration.py # Integration tests  
    ├── run_tests.py               # Enhanced test runner
    ├── pytest.ini                # Clean configuration
    └── README.md                  # Documentation
```

**Study this example** - it's the gold standard for:
- Clean architecture implementation

## 🛠️ Development Tools

### **Essential Tools**

1. **Tool Debugger** (`tools/tool_debugger/debug_tool.py`)
   - Your primary development and debugging tool
   - Automatic configuration loading
   - Interactive tool testing

2. **Test Runners** (in each tool's `tests/` directory)
   - `run_tests.py` - Enhanced test runner with marker support
   - Component and integration test separation
   - Clean output and error reporting

3. **Configuration Files**
   - `.env` - Centralized API keys and settings
   - `.local_workspaces.json` - Workspace configurations
   - `pytest.ini` - Test configuration

### **Development Workflow**

```bash
# 1. Interactive Development
cd tools/tool_debugger
python example.py  # See debug_tool in action

# 2. Test-Driven Development  
cd tools/your_tool/tests
python run_tests.py component     # Fast feedback
python run_tests.py integration   # End-to-end validation
python run_tests.py all          # Complete test suite

# 3. Manual Debugging
python -c \"
import asyncio
from debug_tool import ToolDebugger

async def debug():
    debugger = ToolDebugger()
    await debugger.setup_tool('agent_c_tools.YourTool', {})
    debugger.print_tool_info()

asyncio.run(debug())
\"
```

## 🔧 Configuration Setup

### **Required Configuration Files**

Create these in your agent_c base directory (`C:\Users\justj\PycharmProjects\agent_c\`):

#### **.env**
```env
# API Keys
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here
WEATHER_API_KEY=your_weather_key
FLASHDOCS_API_KEY=your_flashdocs_key

# Database
DATABASE_URL=your_database_url

# Settings
DEBUG=True
LOG_LEVEL=INFO
```

#### **.local_workspaces.json**
```json
{
  \"local_workspaces\": [
    {
      \"workspace_name\": \"Documents\",
      \"workspace_root\": \"C:\\\\Users\\\\justj\\\\Documents\"
    }
  ]
}
```

### **Dependencies**

```bash
# Core dependencies (already installed)
pip install agent_c

# Testing dependencies
pip install pytest pytest-asyncio

# Optional but recommended
pip install python-dotenv  # For .env loading
```

## 🚨 Common Issues & Solutions

### **Configuration Issues**
- **Problem**: Debug_tool can't find agent_c directory
- **Solution**: Check paths in debug_tool logs, specify `agent_c_base_path` explicitly

### **Test Issues**
- **Problem**: Tests can't import modules
- **Solution**: Check `sys.path.insert()` statements in test files

### **Tool Issues**
- **Problem**: Tool not found in debug_tool
- **Solution**: Verify exact class name in `tool_import_path`

### **API Issues**
- **Problem**: Tools failing with authentication errors
- **Solution**: Check .env file location and API key values
