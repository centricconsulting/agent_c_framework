# Ensure Datasource is setup
- Ensure you have the `Chinook.sqlite` database setup in the `data_demo` folder.  If you do not have it, you can download it from [here](https://www.sqlitetutorial.net/sqlite-sample-database/).  Once you have it, place it in the `data_demo` folder.
- See here for more details [data_demo/data_setup.md](data_demo/data_setup.md)
