      lesson: '**Memory Tool Status & Workspace Metadata Alternative**: The basic
        memory tool is currently broken and should be skipped. However, the WorkspaceTool
        has been enhanced with metadata capabilities that can serve as an agent memory
        store. This is a critical finding that affects documentation priorities -
        workspace documentation needs to be updated to highlight these memory storage
        capabilities as an alternative to the broken memory tool.'

      lesson: '**Plan Restructuring for Thoroughness**: Restructured the plan from
        grouped phases to individual tasks per documentation file. This approach ensures
        more thorough attention to each tool and better progress tracking. Each documentation
        task now has specific context about the tool''s complexity and key features
        to cover.'

      lesson: '**Documentation Structure for Complex Tools**: For complex tools like
        browser_playwright (813 lines), comprehensive documentation requires multiple
        sections: practical use cases, complete API reference, workflow examples,
        best practices, and troubleshooting. The tool had existing README.md in its
        source directory, but the official documentation needed to be created in //project/docs/tools/
        following the naming convention README_[TOOL_NAME].md. The accessibility-based
        element interaction approach is a key differentiator that needed emphasis
        in the documentation.'

      lesson: '**Metadata as Memory Store Documentation**: When documenting workspace
        metadata capabilities, it''s crucial to position them as a direct replacement
        for broken memory tools. The documentation must emphasize the advantages:
        reliability, speed, structured data support, and persistence. Key sections
        needed include practical examples for agent memory patterns, session management,
        user preferences, and nested data structures. The API reference should show
        both simple and complex use cases with clear UNC path examples (//workspace/meta/key/subkey).'

      lesson: '**Critical Documentation Perspective Error**: Made a major mistake
        by writing user documentation from a developer perspective with code examples.
        User documentation should focus on what agents can do FOR users, not how to
        implement the tools. Key corrections: remove all code examples, use "agents
        can help you" language instead of API parameters, focus on user benefits and
        practical scenarios, replace technical troubleshooting with user-focused Q&A.
        Always verify documentation perspective matches the intended audience before
        marking complete.'

      lesson: '**Mathematical Tool Documentation Strategy**: For complex mathematical
        tools with extensive capabilities (849 lines), organize documentation by mathematical
        domains rather than individual functions. Key approach: group related capabilities
        (arithmetic, calculus, algebra, statistics, etc.), emphasize practical applications
        over technical specifications, include security features as user benefits,
        and structure Q&A around common user concerns. The math tool required balancing
        comprehensive coverage with accessibility - users need to understand both
        basic arithmetic and advanced calculus capabilities without being overwhelmed
        by technical details.'

      lesson: '**Knowledge Graph Documentation Strategy**: For sophisticated knowledge
        management tools, emphasize the conceptual advantages over traditional information
        storage rather than technical implementation. Key approach: explain entities,
        relations, and observations as user-friendly concepts, highlight intelligence
        benefits (relationship-aware insights, context preservation, discovery capabilities),
        provide diverse use cases across domains (project management, research, business,
        education), and position knowledge graphs as transformative for agent intelligence.
        Users need to understand why structured knowledge networks are superior to
        unstructured notes, not how to implement graph algorithms.'

      lesson: '**Project Management Tool Documentation Strategy**: For sophisticated
        planning tools, emphasize the strategic advantages of structured methodology
        over simple task management. Key approach: highlight rich context as a differentiator
        (technical, business, implementation, risk contexts), demonstrate knowledge
        capture value through lessons learned, show integration benefits with development
        workflows, and position hierarchical task organization as essential for complex
        project success. Users need to understand why structured planning with rich
        context beats simple to-do lists, not the technical implementation of task
        management systems.'

      lesson: '**Reasoning Tool Documentation Strategy**: For sophisticated thinking
        tools, emphasize the cognitive advantages of structured methodology over intuitive
        problem-solving. Key approach: highlight systematic decomposition as superior
        to ad-hoc thinking, demonstrate revision and branching capabilities as unique
        differentiators, position uncertainty management as a strength rather than
        weakness, and show how reasoning transparency enables collaboration and accountability.
        Users need to understand why structured thinking with revision capabilities
        beats informal problem-solving, not the technical implementation of thought
        management systems.'
