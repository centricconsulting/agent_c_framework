# Cleanup Note

Removing test scripts as the user correctly pointed out they should not be in scratch.
The proper approach is to use the existing UiPath tool directly through the Agent C framework.

Files removed:
- create_uipath_asset.py
- test_uipath_asset.py  
- test_uipath_import.py

The UiPath tool is properly implemented at:
//tools/src/agent_c_tools/tools/uipath/tool.py

And registered in the toolset system.
