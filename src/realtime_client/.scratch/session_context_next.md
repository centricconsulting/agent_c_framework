Hank, let's continue building the Agent C Realtime Client SDK. Here's where we left off:

**Completed Tasks (7 of 15):**
1. ✅ TypeScript Configuration
2. ✅ Event System Foundation  
3. ✅ WebSocket Client
4. ✅ Authentication Manager
5. ✅ Turn Management System
6. ✅ Audio Input System (complete with 7-step implementation)
7. ✅ Audio Output System

**What We Built Last Session:**
- Complete audio pipeline with binary WebSocket streaming (fixed virt_joe issue!)
- AudioService, AudioAgentCBridge, AudioOutputService singletons
- Turn-aware audio transmission
- Voice model awareness (skips playback in avatar mode)
- React hooks (useAudio, useTurnState) for easy integration
- Everything builds cleanly and is committed to git

**Current Architecture:**
- Workspace: //realtime_client
- Plan: agentc_sdk_dev
- Monorepo with @agentc/realtime-core and @agentc/realtime-react packages
- Binary audio streaming working (Mic → Server → Speakers)
- Authentication with auto-refresh
- Turn management preventing talk-over

**Next Priority Tasks (in sequence):**
8. Voice Model Manager - Handle voice selection and changes
9. Chat Session Management - Session creation/switching/history
10. Avatar Integration - HeyGen avatar support
11. React Provider and Context
12. React Core Hooks (partially done - need useVoiceModel, useRealtimeClient)

**Key Technical Context:**
- We're following a "no gold plating" approach
- Using singleton patterns for services
- Binary-first for audio (no base64)
- The API is still evolving, backward compatibility is NOT required
- Use clones for implementation work to save context

The audio system is fully functional. We can now have voice conversations with agents! Ready to continue with Voice Model Manager or would you prefer to tackle something else first?

## Current Project Status

### Completed Components
- **Core Infrastructure**: TypeScript config, Event system, WebSocket client
- **Authentication**: JWT management with auto-refresh, storage abstraction
- **Turn Management**: Simple binary state tracking for input control
- **Audio System**: Complete input/output pipeline with binary streaming
- **React Hooks**: useAudio and useTurnState implemented

### Audio System Architecture
```
Input:  Microphone → AudioService → AudioAgentCBridge → RealtimeClient → WebSocket → Server
Output: Server → WebSocket → RealtimeClient → AudioOutputService → Speakers
```

### Key Achievements
- Fixed virt_joe's base64 issue - using raw binary frames
- 33% bandwidth reduction with binary streaming
- Turn-aware audio prevents talking over agent
- Voice model awareness for avatar/TTS/text modes
- Clean separation of concerns with singleton services

### File Structure
```
//realtime_client/
  packages/
    core/
      src/
        audio/          # Complete audio system
        auth/           # Authentication manager
        client/         # RealtimeClient, WebSocket
        events/         # Event system
        session/        # TurnManager
    react/
      src/
        hooks/          # useAudio, useTurnState
  worklets/
    audio-processor.worklet.js  # PCM16 processing
```

### Build Status
✅ All TypeScript compiles successfully
✅ No errors in npm run build
✅ Ready for next features

### Important Notes
- Code is greenfield - backward compatibility not required
- Agent C API is still evolving rapidly
- Focus on getting demo working, then solidify
- Use delegation to clones for implementation
