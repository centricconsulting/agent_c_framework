# Agent C Realtime Client SDK - Session Context

## Previous Session Summary (2024-01-28 - Session 3)

Completed Task 4 of the SDK development plan, implementing comprehensive authentication management.

## Completed Tasks ✅

### Task 1: TypeScript Configuration ✅
- Created tsconfig.json files for packages/core and packages/react
- Set up strict TypeScript settings with ES module output
- Configured monorepo with composite project references

### Task 2: Event System Foundation ✅
- Built type-safe EventEmitter class with TypeScript generics
- Created complete event type definitions (11 client events, 18 server events)
- Implemented EventRegistry for type mappings
- All events match API spec from `//api/docs/realtime_api_implementation_guide.md`

### Task 3: WebSocket Client ✅
- Implemented RealtimeClient class extending EventEmitter
- Created WebSocketManager for low-level WebSocket operations
- Built ReconnectionManager with exponential backoff
- Added all client command methods (setAgent, textInput, etc.)
- Handles both JSON events and binary audio frames
- Uses browser-compatible types (no NodeJS dependencies)

### Task 4: Authentication Manager ✅
- Implemented AuthManager class with full JWT token management
- Created AuthConfig with storage abstraction for tokens
- Built-in memory and localStorage token storage implementations
- Automatic token refresh before expiry with configurable buffer
- Login/logout flow with REST API integration
- HeyGen token management alongside Agent C tokens
- Event-driven authentication state changes
- Integrated with RealtimeClient for seamless authentication
- Type-safe throughout with comprehensive error handling

## Current Status

### Repository State
- **Workspace:** `//realtime_client`
- **Build Status:** ✅ Successfully builds
- **Packages:**
  - `@agentc/realtime-core` - Has events, client, and auth modules
  - `@agentc/realtime-react` - Shell ready for React bindings

### Development Plan Progress
- **Plan:** `agentc_sdk_dev` (15 tasks total)
- **Completed:** Tasks 1, 2, 3, 4
- **Next Task:** Task 5 - Turn Management System

## Key Features Implemented

### Authentication Manager
- **Login Flow**: POST to `/rt/login` with credentials
- **Token Management**: Stores both Agent C and HeyGen tokens
- **Automatic Refresh**: Refreshes tokens before expiry (1 minute buffer by default)
- **Storage Abstraction**: Pluggable storage (memory, localStorage, custom)
- **JWT Parsing**: Extracts expiry from JWT for scheduling refresh
- **Event System**: Emits auth events (login, logout, tokens-refreshed, state-changed, error)
- **Client Integration**: RealtimeClient can use AuthManager for automatic token handling

### Integration Points
- RealtimeClient accepts AuthManager instance in config
- Auth tokens automatically update in client on refresh
- UI session ID from login response used for reconnection
- Login data (agents, avatars, voices, toolsets) accessible via AuthManager

## Next Steps (Task 5: Turn Management System)

Implement turn management to handle conversation flow:
- Track user_turn_start/end events from server
- Prevent audio transmission during agent turns
- Maintain turn history for debugging
- Observable turn state for UI updates
- Integrate with audio system (when implemented)

## Important Notes

- **No backward compatibility required** - This is a greenfield project
- **API still evolving** - Expect changes to the realtime API
- **Focus on quality** - Clean architecture over quick fixes
- **One task at a time** - Complete, test, commit before moving on
- **Browser-first** - All implementations must work in browser environment
