## React Tiptap Editor Integration

When using Tiptap with React, the most common performance issue is that the editor is re-rendered too often. This demo shows the difference between the default editor and the optimized rendering with `shouldRerenderOnTransaction`.

## Get editor state information without impacting performance

If you need to access the editor state without causing a re-render, you can use the `useEditorState` hook. This allows you to read the editor state without triggering a re-render of your component.
