Beyond that, we might need to consider distributed processing.\n\n**Optimization Strategies**:\n- Caching frequently accessed data\n- Using efficient data structures\n- Implementing lazy evaluation where appropriate\n- Parallel processing for independent operations\n\n**Trade-offs**: We're prioritizing reliability and maintainability over raw speed, which seems appropriate for this use case.",
