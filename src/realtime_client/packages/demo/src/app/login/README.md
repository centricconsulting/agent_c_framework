# Login Page Implementation

## Overview
Professional login page for the Agent C Realtime demo application using CenSuite/shadcn components.

## Features
- ✅ Clean, professional form design using Card components
- ✅ Username and password fields with validation
- ✅ Form validation using react-hook-form and zod
- ✅ Error display for failed authentication attempts
- ✅ Loading state while authenticating
- ✅ Automatic redirect to /dashboard on successful login
- ✅ Accessibility compliant with ARIA labels and keyboard navigation
- ✅ Responsive design that works on all screen sizes

## Technical Implementation

### Form Validation
- Uses `react-hook-form` for form state management
- Zod schema validation for required field checks
- Real-time validation feedback through FormMessage components

### Authentication Flow
1. User enters credentials
2. Form validates input on submission
3. Calls `login()` from `@/lib/auth` service
4. Shows loading state during authentication
5. On success: Redirects to /dashboard
6. On failure: Displays error message and clears password field

### Security Considerations
- Password field cleared on failed login attempts
- Uses proper autocomplete attributes for password managers
- Implements secure cookie storage via the auth service
- Loading state prevents multiple submission attempts

### Accessibility Features
- Proper ARIA labels on interactive elements
- Form validation messages linked to inputs
- Keyboard navigation fully supported
- Loading state announced to screen readers
- Semantic HTML structure with proper heading hierarchy

### Styling
- Follows CenSuite design system color tokens
- Consistent spacing using Tailwind's 4px base unit
- Professional typography hierarchy
- Responsive layout centered on all screen sizes
- Proper focus states for keyboard navigation
