## Recommended Next Steps

### 1. Tool-Related Components

Focus on tool-related components:

- ToolSelector
- ToolCallManager
- FileUploadManager
- FilesPanel

### 2. Address Message Rendering Issues

Now that all message components have been migrated to use shadcn/ui, we should address any rendering issues across all message types:

- Test all message types in combination to ensure consistent spacing and appearance
- Verify that messages appear correctly in both light and dark modes
- Ensure proper responsiveness on different screen sizes
- Fix any visual inconsistencies or rendering bugs

### 3. CSS Structure Review

Conduct a thorough review of the CSS structure:

- Ensure all components follow the naming conventions
- Verify all styles are properly scoped to their components
- Check for any remaining inline styles
- Validate consistent use of CSS variables

### 4. Theme Consistency

Ensure theme consistency across all components:

- Verify all components work correctly in both light and dark mode
- Ensure proper use of CSS variables for theming
- Check for any hardcoded colors or styles

### 5. Documentation

Update documentation to reflect the new component structure:

- Create usage examples for the migrated components
- Document any custom extensions to shadcn/ui components
- Update style guides with consistent patterns
