# Sidebar Alignment Fix

## Issue
The sidebar has text and navigation items that are centered instead of left-aligned when collapsed.

## Changes Made

1. Updated CSS rule for collapsed menu buttons in app-sidebar.css:
   - Changed `justify-content: center;` to `justify-content: flex-start;`
   - This ensures that even when the sidebar is collapsed, the icons remain left-aligned

## Result
These changes will make the 'Agent C' logo and navigation items consistently left-aligned in both expanded and collapsed states, providing a more consistent and professional sidebar appearance.
