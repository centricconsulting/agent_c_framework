# TokenUsageDisplay Component Standardization

## Overview
The TokenUsageDisplay component has been standardized to align with our project's design patterns and best practices. This component displays token usage statistics in assistant messages, showing prompt, completion, and total token counts.

## Implementation Details

### Original Implementation
The original implementation used inline styles directly in the JSX, lacked accessibility features, and had no dedicated CSS file. While functional, it was not following our standardized approach.

### Standardization Changes

1. **Created Dedicated CSS File**
   - Created `token-usage-display.css` in the components styles directory
   - Organized with standard header format and section comments
   - Imported in main.css to ensure proper loading

2. **Replaced Inline Styles**
   - Replaced all inline styles with CSS classes
   - Created semantic class names following our naming convention
   - Separated styling concerns from the component logic

3. **Enhanced Accessibility**
   - Added ARIA attributes and labels
   - Added proper screen reader support
   - Made the component more semantically correct with appropriate roles
   - Improved the structure for better keyboard navigation

4. **Improved Responsive Design**
   - Enhanced mobile view with flexible layouts
   - Added media queries for small screens
   - Ensured proper spacing and readability on all devices

5. **Added Dark Mode Support**
   - Used CSS variables for color consistency
   - Added dark mode specific styles
   - Ensured proper contrast in both light and dark modes

6. **Added Documentation and Type Validation**
   - Added comprehensive JSDoc comments
   - Implemented PropTypes validation
   - Documented all props and their expected types

## CSS Structure
The CSS file is organized with clear sections:
- Container styling
- Icon styling
- Stats container and items
- Responsive media queries
- Dark mode enhancements

## Future Considerations
- Consider adding animation for hover states
- Potentially integrate with a tooltip component for more detailed information
- Add configurability for showing/hiding specific metrics

## Conclusion
The TokenUsageDisplay component now follows our standardized approach, with proper styling, accessibility, and responsive design. It maintains a clean separation of concerns between styling and component logic, making it more maintainable and consistent with the rest of the application.
