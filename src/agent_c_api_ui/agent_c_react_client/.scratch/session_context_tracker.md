# SessionContext Analysis Tracker

## Current Analysis Approach
Performing a manual, systematic code analysis to understand SessionContext instead of runtime logging.

## Key Observations So Far

1. ✅ **SessionContext is Overloaded:** It handles authentication, model configuration, chat state, theming, file management, API calls, and localStorage operations

2. ✅ **Circular Dependency Pattern:** ThemeProvider uses SessionContext, but SessionContext is also the parent of ThemeProvider in App.jsx

3. ✅ **Theme Management is Fragmented:** Theme state is in SessionContext, but theme application is in ThemeProvider with theme utility functions in theme.ts

4. ✅ **Poor Separation of Concerns:** API calls are embedded directly in SessionContext with direct localStorage access scattered throughout

5. ✅ **Complex State Management:** Too many interconnected pieces of state managed with useState and complex initialization logic

## Next Steps for Analysis

1. ⬜ **Map Component Dependencies** - Document which components use SessionContext and which specific properties/methods they consume

2. ⬜ **Identify Core Responsibilities** - Group SessionContext functionality into logical domains (auth, model config, theme, chat state, etc.)

3. ⬜ **Document Data Flow** - Create diagrams showing how data flows through the application

4. ⬜ **Design Context Separation Plan** - Plan how to extract focused contexts (ThemeContext, AuthContext, etc.)

## Planned Context Extraction Order

1. ⬜ **ThemeContext** - Most isolated functionality, good starting point with minimal dependencies

2. ⬜ **AuthContext** - Session management and authentication

3. ⬜ **ModelContext** - Model selection and configuration

4. ⬜ **ChatContext** - Message handling and streaming

5. ⬜ **FileContext** - File upload and management
