# Tool Call Display Redesign

## Background
We had an issue with the tool call display after moving it to the footer of the assistant message. The display was getting constrained within the footer container, causing layout problems.

## Solution

We've implemented a solution that moves the tool call display below the chat bubble, while maintaining a visual connection to the message it belongs to.

### UI/UX Improvements

1. **Visual Distinction**
   - Added a distinct background with subtle pattern to differentiate tool calls from the chat background
   - Enhanced borders and shadows to create better visual separation
   - Created a visual connector (small vertical line) between the message and tool calls

2. **Visual Hierarchy**
   - Redesigned the toggle button in the footer to be more visible and actionable
   - Made tool call components more prominent with hover effects and better contrast
   - Ensured appropriate visual grouping so users understand these are related to the assistant message

3. **Color and Styling Enhancements**
   - Used the primary color to create a cohesive design language
   - Added subtle visual effects (backdrop blur, pattern background) to create depth
   - Improved responsive design for both mobile and large screens

4. **Interactive Elements**
   - Enhanced hover states for better user feedback
   - Added subtle animations for expanding/collapsing tool calls
   - Improved the toggle button to be more noticeable and clickable

### Technical Implementation

1. Modified `tool-call-display.css` to add:
   - Visual connector line to show relationship with message bubble
   - Enhanced backgrounds with subtle patterns
   - Better shadow and border styling

2. Updated `tool-call-item.css` to improve:
   - Container styling with better borders and shadows
   - Header styling with improved contrast
   - Hover effects for better interactivity

3. Simplified `assistant-message.css` by removing redundant styles that were moved to the `tool-call-display.css` file

## Benefits

- **Better Visual Distinction**: Tool calls now stand out from the chat background
- **Clear Relationship**: The visual connector shows that tool calls belong to specific messages
- **Improved Usability**: Enhanced contrast and interactive elements improve UX
- **Consistent Design Language**: Uses existing color variables and design patterns for a cohesive look
