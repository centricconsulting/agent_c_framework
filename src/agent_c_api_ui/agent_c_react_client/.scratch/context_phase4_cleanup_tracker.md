# Context Refactoring: Phase 4 Cleanup Tracker

## Status Summary

**Current Status**: Application not loading properly after context refactoring
**Priority**: HIGH - Fix loading issues
**Last Updated**: Sunday April 27, 2025

## Stage 1: Enhanced Diagnostics

| Task | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Create diagnostic framework | ðŸ”„ Not Started | Need to add to diagnostic.js |
| Implement context initialization tracking | ðŸ”„ Not Started | Will track order and timing |
| Add detailed logging | ðŸ”„ Not Started | Entry/exit logging for critical paths |
| Create error boundaries | ðŸ”„ Not Started | Need component for each context |
| Implement browser console diagnostics | ðŸ”„ Not Started | Global object for easy access |

## Stage 2: Fix Critical Issues

| Task | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Verify context initialization order | ðŸ”„ Not Started | Check dependencies between contexts |
| Fix circular dependencies | ðŸ”„ Not Started | Check import statements |
| Add loading states | ðŸ”„ Not Started | Prevent premature context access |
| Implement timeouts | ðŸ”„ Not Started | For all async operations |
| Fix race conditions | ðŸ”„ Not Started | In initialization sequence |

## Stage 3: Component Updates

| Task | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Update ChatInterface | ðŸ”„ Not Started | Use specific context hooks |
| Update SidebarCommandMenu | ðŸ”„ Not Started | Remove SessionContext dependency |
| Update Layout components | ðŸ”„ Not Started | Add error boundaries |
| Verify App.jsx provider order | âœ… Completed | Provider hierarchy looks correct |

## Stage 4: Testing and Validation

| Task | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Test initialization sequence | ðŸ”„ Not Started | Verify contexts initialize properly |
| Test authentication flows | ðŸ”„ Not Started | Login, logout, session restoration |
| Test theme switching | ðŸ”„ Not Started | Verify theme changes propagate |
| Test model selection | ðŸ”„ Not Started | Verify model changes apply |

## Stage 5: Documentation and Finalization

| Task | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Update architecture docs | ðŸ”„ Not Started | Document new context structure |
| Create developer guidelines | ðŸ”„ Not Started | For using the new contexts |
| Clean up diagnostic code | ðŸ”„ Not Started | Once stable |

## Issues Log

| Issue | Priority | Status | Notes |
|-------|----------|--------|-------|
| App not loading | HIGH | ðŸ”„ Investigating | After context refactoring |
| Potential circular dependencies | HIGH | ðŸ”„ Investigating | Between context providers |
| Components not updated | MEDIUM | ðŸ”„ Not Started | May still use old SessionContext |

## Next Steps

1. Implement diagnostic framework in diagnostic.js
2. Add initialization tracking to all context providers
3. Test application startup with enhanced logging
4. Identify specific loading failure point

## Completion Criteria

- All contexts initialize properly in the correct order
- Components use the appropriate context hooks
- Application loads and functions correctly
- Error cases are handled gracefully
- Comprehensive diagnostics are available for troubleshooting
