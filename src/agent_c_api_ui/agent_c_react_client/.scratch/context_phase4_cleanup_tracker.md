# Context Refactoring: Phase 4 Cleanup Tracker

## Status Summary

**Current Status**: Application not loading properly after context refactoring
**Priority**: HIGH - Fix loading issues
**Last Updated**: Sunday April 27, 2025

## Stage 1: Enhanced Diagnostics

| Task | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Create diagnostic framework | âœ… Completed | Added to diagnostic.js |
| Implement context initialization tracking | âœ… Completed | Tracking order and timing in all contexts |
| Add detailed logging | âœ… Completed | Added to all context providers |
| Create error boundaries | âœ… Completed | Added ErrorBoundary component and wrapped all context providers |
| Implement browser console diagnostics | âœ… Completed | Added global window.diagnosticReport function |

## Stage 2: Fix Critical Issues

| Task | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Verify context initialization order | âœ… Completed | Tracked in diagnostic framework |
| Fix circular dependencies | ðŸ”„ In Progress | Contexts now use hooks to access other contexts |
| Add loading states | âœ… Completed | Added to all context providers |
| Implement timeouts | âœ… Completed | Added to async operations |
| Fix race conditions | ðŸ”„ In Progress | Improved with better state tracking |

## Stage 3: Component Updates

| Task | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Update ChatInterface | ðŸ”„ Not Started | Use specific context hooks |
| Update SidebarCommandMenu | ðŸ”„ Not Started | Remove SessionContext dependency |
| Update Layout components | ðŸ”„ Not Started | Add error boundaries |
| Verify App.jsx provider order | âœ… Completed | Provider hierarchy looks correct |

## Stage 4: Testing and Validation

| Task | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Test initialization sequence | ðŸ”„ Not Started | Verify contexts initialize properly |
| Test authentication flows | ðŸ”„ Not Started | Login, logout, session restoration |
| Test theme switching | ðŸ”„ Not Started | Verify theme changes propagate |
| Test model selection | ðŸ”„ Not Started | Verify model changes apply |

## Stage 5: Documentation and Finalization

| Task | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Update architecture docs | ðŸ”„ Not Started | Document new context structure |
| Create developer guidelines | ðŸ”„ Not Started | For using the new contexts |
| Clean up diagnostic code | ðŸ”„ Not Started | Once stable |

## Issues Log

| Issue | Priority | Status | Notes |
|-------|----------|--------|-------|
| ModelContext using incorrect API method | HIGH | âœ… Fixed | Changed apiService.get('/models') to apiService.getModels() |
| App not loading | HIGH | ðŸ”„ Investigating | After context refactoring |
| AuthContext using incorrect storage method | HIGH | âœ… Fixed | Changed storageService.get(SESSION_ID_KEY) to storageService.getSessionId() |
| ModelContext storage access method | HIGH | âœ… Fixed | Changed storageService.get(AGENT_CONFIG_KEY) to storageService.getAgentConfig() |
| Potential circular dependencies | HIGH | ðŸ”„ Investigating | Between context providers |
| Components not updated | MEDIUM | ðŸ”„ Not Started | May still use old SessionContext |

## Next Steps

1. âœ… Implement diagnostic framework in diagnostic.js - COMPLETED
2. âœ… Add initialization tracking to all context providers - COMPLETED
3. âœ… Fix ModelContext.fetchModels to use correct API method - COMPLETED
4. âœ… Fix AuthContext.jsx to use correct storageService methods - COMPLETED
5. âœ… Fix ModelContext.jsx to use correct storageService methods - COMPLETED
6. Test application startup with enhanced logging - NEXT STEP
7. Continue identifying any other loading issues
8. âœ… Create error boundary components for each context provider - COMPLETED

## Completion Criteria

- All contexts initialize properly in the correct order
- Components use the appropriate context hooks
- Application loads and functions correctly
- Error cases are handled gracefully
- Comprehensive diagnostics are available for troubleshooting
## Update: April 27, 2025

### Issues Fixed Today

| Issue | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Missing window.getContextDiagnostics() | âœ… Fixed | Added alias to existing contextInitializationDiagnostic function |
| SessionContext not initializing properly | âœ… Fixed | Modified useEffect to properly mark context as complete |

### Actions Taken

1. âœ… Fixed the missing global diagnostics function by creating an alias for contextInitializationDiagnostic
2. âœ… Fixed SessionContext initialization by ensuring proper tracking of completion
3. âœ… Created implementation guide for context diagnostics in .scratch/context_diagnostics_implementation_guide.md
4. âœ… Updated the tracker with latest progress

### Next Steps

1. Test application startup and verify contexts initialize properly
2. Update ChatInterface components to use the specific context hooks
3. Verify command menu functionality
4. Complete remaining update tasks
