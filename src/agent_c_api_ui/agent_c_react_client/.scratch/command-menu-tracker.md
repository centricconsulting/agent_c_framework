# SessionContext Refactoring Tracker

## Current Status
**Overall Progress**: Phase 1, Session 1
**Current Task**: Setting up logging infrastructure

## Installed Packages
- ✅ loglevel - For configurable logging
- ✅ @redux-devtools/extension - For state visualization
- ✅ zustand - Lightweight state management
- ❌ @welldone-software/why-did-you-render - Skipped due to React version compatibility issues

## Progress

### Session 1 Progress
1. ✅ Created custom logging utility based on loglevel
2. ✅ Implemented a simple render tracker using React hooks
3. ✅ Added extensive logging to SessionContext
4. ✅ Created debug panel component
5. ✅ Updated ThemeProvider with logging
6. ✅ Created custom hooks for SessionContext usage tracking

## Next Steps
1. Test the logging infrastructure by using the application
2. Update ChatInterface.jsx with logging
3. Update key components that use SessionContext
4. Complete Session 1 and prepare for Session 2

## Recent Accomplishments
- Completed initial analysis of SessionContext issues
- Created comprehensive refactoring plan
- Installed necessary packages for logging and state management
- Implemented logging infrastructure with the following components:
  - `logger.js` - Core logging utility
  - `use-logger.jsx` - React hooks for component and state logging
  - `debug-panel.jsx` - UI component for viewing logs
  - `use-session-context.jsx` - Custom hooks for SessionContext usage

## Issues and Blockers
- @welldone-software/why-did-you-render is not compatible with our React version (18.3.1)
  - Solution: Created a custom render tracking solution using React hooks

## Notes from Last Session
Initial analysis revealed several issues with SessionContext:
- Overloaded with responsibilities
- Circular dependencies
- Fragmented theme management
- Poor separation of concerns
- Complex state management

## Questions for Next Session
- Which components are most frequently re-rendering due to SessionContext changes?
- Are there parts of SessionContext that are rarely used but causing re-renders?
- Which context properties should be separated out first based on usage patterns?
