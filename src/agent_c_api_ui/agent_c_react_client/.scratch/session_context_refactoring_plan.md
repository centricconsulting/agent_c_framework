# SessionContext Refactoring Plan - REVISED

## Packages Installed
- loglevel
- @redux-devtools/extension
- zustand

## Phase 1: Analysis and Planning (Current)

### Session 1: Targeted Analysis Approach

**CHANGE OF APPROACH:** Our initial debug/logging implementation was too invasive and caused UI issues. We're switching to a more targeted approach.

#### New Strategy:
1. Add minimal, strategic logging to critical points only
2. Create a data flow diagram manually by analyzing code
3. Implement SessionContext usage tracking by adding a lightweight wrapper

#### Deliverables:
- Dependency graph showing which components use which parts of SessionContext
- Data flow documentation highlighting state update patterns
- List of refactoring priorities based on impact and risk
- Implementation plan for splitting contexts

## Phase 2: Context Separation (Future)

(Rest of plan follows as before...)
