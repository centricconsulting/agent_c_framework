# Spun Pearl Color Palette Integration

## Overview

The Spun Pearl color palette has been integrated into the Agent C React UI's light mode theme. This palette features a series of soft, pearlescent blue and purple hues that create a calm, professional atmosphere while maintaining excellent readability and visual harmony.

## Palette Colors

1. **Cold Purple** (#aab0de)
   - A soft, lavender-tinted purple that adds visual interest
   - Used for accent elements and borders

2. **Jagged Ice** (#bbdae6)
   - A muted blue-gray with a hint of teal
   - Used for muted elements and secondary backgrounds

3. **Link Water** (#d4ecf3)
   - A light, airy blue with excellent contrast for text
   - Used as the main application background

4. **Polar** (#e7f7fa)
   - A nearly white blue with just enough color to feel fresh
   - Used for cards and higher-level elements

5. **Twilight Blue** (#f7ffff)
   - An extremely light blue that reads as white while maintaining the theme
   - Used for popovers and tool backgrounds

## Benefits of the New Palette

1. **Visual Cohesion**: The palette creates a unified visual experience with harmonious color relationships

2. **Reduced Eye Strain**: The soft blue tones are easier on the eyes during extended use compared to stark white backgrounds

3. **Professional Appearance**: The pearlescent quality adds a premium feel to the interface

4. **Maintained Readability**: All text colors remain unchanged to ensure optimal readability

5. **Clear Hierarchy**: The varying blue tones help establish visual hierarchy between UI elements
