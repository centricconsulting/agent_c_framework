# CSS Refactor Phase 2: Consolidation and Cleanup Plan

## Current State Analysis
- CSS file size: 2265 lines, 54502 characters
- Component sections identified in comments but not recognized by CSS tools
- File is organized by component sections with clear headers

## Objectives
1. Reorganize CSS to be compatible with the new CSS tools
2. Consolidate and clean up redundant styles
3. Optimize the structure for better maintainability
4. Establish a sustainable pattern for future CSS additions

## Phase 2 Plan

### Step 1: Understand Tool Requirements and Current Structure
- Analyze how the CSS tools expect component sections to be formatted
- Create a complete inventory of current component sections
- Identify any patterns or inconsistencies in the current CSS

### Step 2: Define New Structure
- Design a standardized format for component sections that works with the tools
- Create a template for new component sections
- Define naming conventions and organization principles

### Step 3: Reorganize Component Sections
- Reformat each component section to match the new structure
- Add any missing metadata or markers needed for tools
- Ensure consistent formatting across all sections

### Step 4: Consolidate and Clean
- Identify and merge duplicate styles
- Extract common patterns into reusable classes
- Remove any unused or redundant styles

### Step 5: Optimize for Maintainability
- Add clear documentation for future contributors
- Create a guide for adding new component styles
- Ensure proper use of CSS variables for theming

### Step 6: Testing and Verification
- Ensure no visual regressions after changes
- Verify compatibility with the CSS tools
- Test across different screen sizes and themes

## Implementation Approach
- Work on one component section at a time
- Make incremental changes that can be easily tested
- Keep original styles in comments or backup files until verified
- Use the new CSS tools to verify changes as we go
