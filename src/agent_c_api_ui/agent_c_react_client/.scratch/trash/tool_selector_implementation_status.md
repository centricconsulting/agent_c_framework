# ToolSelector Implementation Status

## Changes Made

1. **Component Structure**
   - Maintained the existing three-part structure (EssentialTools, ToolCategory, ToolSelector)
   - Kept the organization of tabs for different tool categories

2. **Standardization Improvements**
   - Replaced custom toast implementation with shadcn/ui's useToast hook
   - Improved ScrollArea implementation for better scrolling experience
   - Standardized error states and notifications
   - Improved prop organization and naming consistency

3. **CSS Updates**
   - Updated color variables to use shadcn/ui theme variables consistently
   - Standardized border radius using shadcn/ui variables
   - Improved hover and active states for better interactivity
   - Enhanced accessibility with proper focus states

## Testing Needed

1. **Functionality Testing**
   - Verify tool selection and toggle behavior works properly
   - Test equipping tools and error handling
   - Ensure proper display of essential tools
   - Verify tab navigation between tool categories

2. **UI Testing**
   - Check appearance in both light and dark modes
   - Test responsiveness on different screen sizes
   - Verify tooltip functionality and positioning
   - Ensure active tool highlighting works correctly

3. **Integration Testing**
   - Verify integration with the ChatInterface component
   - Test interaction with the toast notification system
   - Ensure compatibility with existing components

## Next Steps

1. The component is ready for testing. It should be functionally equivalent to the previous version but with improved design consistency and standardized implementation.

2. After testing confirms the component is working correctly, we can move on to standardizing the core shadcn/ui components as outlined in the task tracker.
