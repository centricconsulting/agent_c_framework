# MessagesList Implementation Plan

## Standardization Strategy

The MessagesList component will be standardized to align with shadcn/ui patterns and Tailwind CSS best practices. The focus will be on:

1. Replacing custom CSS classes with Tailwind utility classes
2. Using shadcn/ui theme variables for colors and spacing
3. Improving the component structure and scroll behavior
4. Ensuring consistent styling with other standardized components

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Update MessagesList.jsx

- Replace the current implementation with the standardized version
- Keep the exact same functionality but with improved styling
- Update import paths and ensure compatibility with existing components
- Test scroll behavior and tool selection indicator

### 2. Update messages-list.css

- Since almost all styling has been moved to Tailwind, the CSS file will be minimal
- Only keep custom keyframe animations that can't be handled with Tailwind
- Update main.css to import the new standardized CSS file

### 3. Test Integration

- Verify the component works correctly with MessageItem
- Test scroll behavior with long message lists
- Ensure the scroll-to-top button appears and functions correctly
- Test the tool selection indicator animation

### 4. Verify Theming

- Test in both light and dark modes
- Ensure consistent spacing and styling
- Verify color scheme consistency with other components

## Expected Benefits

1. **Simplified Styling**: Most styling moved to Tailwind utility classes
2. **Better Theme Integration**: Consistent use of shadcn/ui theme variables
3. **Improved Maintainability**: Cleaner component structure and styling
4. **Consistent Appearance**: Better alignment with other standardized components

## Acceptance Criteria

- Component renders correctly and maintains all current functionality
- Styling is consistent in both light and dark themes
- All scroll behaviors work as expected
- Tool selection indicator displays and animates correctly
- All styling uses Tailwind classes or shadcn/ui theme variables
