# ShadCN/UI and Radix UI Implementation Plan

## Current Understanding

- Components in `/components/ui` are correctly implemented and should be used as-is
- Custom application components need to be audited and standardized
- Our focus is on proper usage of shadcn/ui components, not reimplementing them

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Assessment and Documentation (Current Phase)

- [x] Create implementation guide based on official documentation
- [x] Create component evaluation checklist
- [ ] Set up CSS variable mapping between custom and shadcn/ui variables
- [ ] Document proper theming approach

### Phase 2: Component Inventory and Prioritization

- [ ] Inventory all custom application components
- [ ] Identify which components use shadcn/ui components
- [ ] Rate components by visibility and importance to users
- [ ] Prioritize components for standardization
- [ ] Create detailed audit schedule

### Phase 3: CSS Structure Standardization

- [x] Fix CSS import structure
- [ ] Standardize CSS file organization
- [ ] Create variable mapping implementation plan
- [ ] Document CSS best practices specific to our application

### Phase 4: High-Priority Component Standardization

- [ ] Chat interface components (MessagesList, ChatInterface, etc.)
- [ ] Layout components (Sidebar, MobileNav, etc.)
- [ ] Form components and controls

### Phase 5: Medium-Priority Component Standardization

- [ ] RAG interface components
- [ ] Settings components
- [ ] Utility components

### Phase 6: Low-Priority Component Standardization

- [ ] Admin components
- [ ] Debug components
- [ ] Rarely used features

### Phase 7: Testing and Documentation

- [ ] Test all components in light and dark mode
- [ ] Validate responsive behavior
- [ ] Update component documentation
- [ ] Create usage examples for future development

## Priority Components for Initial Focus

1. **ChatInterface Components**
   - MessagesList
   - ChatInputArea
   - MessageItem
   - AssistantMessage
   - UserMessage

2. **Navigation Components**
   - Layout
   - Sidebar
   - MobileNav

3. **Control Components**
   - CollapsibleOptions
   - ToolSelector
   - ModelParameterControls

## Implementation Approach

1. **Start with One Component**
   - Select one high-visibility component
   - Apply evaluation checklist
   - Implement changes according to guide
   - Validate changes work correctly
   - Document process and challenges

2. **Standardize Related Components**
   - Group related components
   - Apply learnings from first component
   - Ensure consistent approach across group

3. **Validate Group Interactions**
   - Test components work together
   - Ensure theme consistency
   - Verify responsive behavior

4. **Documentation and Review**
   - Document changes made
   - Note any deviations from standard
   - Record lessons learned

## Success Criteria

- Component uses shadcn/ui components correctly
- Styling follows project conventions
- Works in both light and dark mode
- Maintains all functionality
- Passes accessibility checks
- CSS specificity is properly managed
- No inline styles for core styling
- Responsive on all target devices
