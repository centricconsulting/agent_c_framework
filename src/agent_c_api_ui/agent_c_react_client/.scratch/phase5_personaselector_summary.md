# PersonaSelector Component Standardization Summary

## Overview

The PersonaSelector component was already well-structured with shadcn/ui components, but we made several important improvements to enhance its accessibility, user experience, and code quality.

## Key Changes Made

1. **Fixed Prop Naming Inconsistency**
   - Updated prop name from `persona` to `persona_name` to match how it's used in CollapsibleOptions
   - Modified all related state management to use the consistent prop name

2. **Enhanced Accessibility**
   - Added proper ARIA attributes:
     - aria-label on form controls
     - aria-describedby for connecting descriptions to inputs
     - role="alert" for error messages
     - aria-live="assertive" for dynamic content updates
     - Added screen reader only (sr-only) descriptions

3. **Improved Mobile Responsiveness**
   - Added additional media queries for small screens
   - Adjusted spacing and control sizes for better mobile experience
   - Ensured overflow content is handled properly

4. **Enhanced Dark Mode Support**
   - Added specific dark mode styling for better contrast
   - Improved background opacity and border styling for dark theme
   - Enhanced readability of vendor headers in dark mode

5. **Better Documentation**
   - Maintained comprehensive JSDoc comments
   - Updated parameter documentation to match actual usage

## Files Modified

1. `src/components/chat_interface/PersonaSelector.jsx`
2. `src/styles/components/persona-selector.css`

## Testing Considerations

The component should be tested to ensure that:
- All changes preserve existing functionality
- The component renders correctly in both light and dark modes
- The component is properly responsive on mobile devices
- Screen readers can correctly interpret the enhanced accessibility features
- The prop naming change doesn't break parent component integration

## Next Component

CollapsibleOptions.jsx will be our next focus for standardization.
