# API Service Layer Migration Implementation Strategy

## Objective

The goal is to migrate the application from the v1 API to the v2 API with minimal disruption to the application's functionality and developer workflow. We need a strategy that allows for incremental adoption, proper testing, and a smooth transition period.

## Implementation Approach: Adapter Pattern

**Description:**
- Implement v2 API services as the core implementation
- Create adapter functions with v1 signatures that internally use v2 services
- Replace v1 implementations with adapters
- Components continue to use the same imports, which now point to adapters
- Gradually update components to use v2 services directly

**Implementation:**
```javascript
// In v1-api-adapters.js
export async function initialize(config) {
  // Convert v1 parameters to v2 format
  const v2Config = {
    model_id: config.model_name,
    persona_id: config.persona_name,
    // ...
  };
  
  // Call v2 API
  const session = await createSession(v2Config);
  
  // Transform response to v1 format
  return {
    ui_session_id: session.id,
    // ...
  };
}

// In services/index.js, export adapted functions with v1 names
export { initialize } from './v1-api-adapters';
```

**Pros:**
- No changes needed to components during initial transition
- Single source of truth (v2 implementation)
- Clear migration path with minimal disruption
- Easier to maintain during transition

**Cons:**
- Some overhead from data transformation
- Temporary adapter code to maintain during transition

## Implementation Plan

### Directory Structure

```
/src/services/
  /v2/                # New v2 services
    api.js
    config-api.js
    session-api.js
    chat-api.js
    history-api.js
    debug-api.js
    index.js
  /adapters/          # v1 compatibility adapters
    index.js
    session-adapters.js
    chat-adapters.js
    ...
  api.js              # Original v1 API base (points to v2 eventually)
  session-api.js      # Updated to use adapters
  model-api.js        # Updated to use adapters
  ...
  index.js            # Main export that maps to appropriate implementation
```

### Transition Strategy

### Phase 1: Base Implementation (1-2 weeks)

1. **Create v2 Service Layer**:
   - Implement v2 API base service with error handling
   - Implement v2 service modules (config, session, chat, etc.)
   - Add unit tests for v2 services

2. **Create Adapter Layer**:
   - Implement adapters for all v1 API functions
   - Test adapters to ensure they transform data correctly
   - Document how adapters map between v1 and v2 formats

### Phase 2: Service Integration (2-3 weeks)

1. **Replace v1 Services with Adapters**:
   - Update v1 service files to import and use adapters
   - Maintain the same exports and signatures
   - Add detailed error logging for debugging

2. **Integration Testing**:
   - Test v1 services with adapter implementations
   - Ensure all components work with adapted services
   - Fix any issues with data transformation

### Phase 3: Component Migration (3-4 weeks)

1. **Identify Component Dependencies**:
   - Map which components use which services
   - Prioritize components for migration
   - Create migration plan for each component

2. **Update Components**:
   - Update components to import v2 services directly
   - Update component code to handle v2 response formats
   - Test each component thoroughly after updates

3. **Documentation & Training**:
   - Document v2 service usage patterns
   - Create examples for common use cases
   - Share knowledge with the team

### Phase 4: Cleanup (1 week)

1. **Remove Adapter Layer**:
   - Once all components use v2 services directly
   - Remove adapter files and references
   - Update imports across the application

2. **Final Testing & Documentation**:
   - Complete end-to-end testing
   - Update all documentation
   - Remove any leftover v1 code

## Transition Timeline

| Phase | Duration | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| Base Implementation | 1-2 weeks | Implement v2 services and adapters |
| Service Integration | 2-3 weeks | Replace v1 with adapters |
| Component Migration | 3-4 weeks | Update components to use v2 directly |
| Cleanup | 1 week | Remove adapters and v1 code |

**Total Timeline: 7-10 weeks**

## Risk Mitigation

1. **Rollback Plan**:
   - Maintain ability to swap back to original v1 services
   - Create backup points before major integration steps
   - Document all changes for easy reversal if needed

2. **Testing Strategy**:
   - Unit tests for v2 services
   - Integration tests for adapter compatibility
   - End-to-end tests for critical flows
   - Component tests with adapted services

3. **Monitoring**:
   - Add detailed logging around API calls
   - Monitor error rates during transition
   - Track performance metrics to ensure no regression

## Success Criteria

1. All API calls successfully migrated to v2
2. No regression in application functionality
3. Improved error handling and response processing
4. Structured service layer for easier maintenance
5. 100% of components using v2 services directly

## Conclusion

By using the adapter pattern, we can migrate to the v2 API with minimal disruption to the application. This approach provides immediate compatibility through adapters while allowing for a gradual transition of components to use the v2 services directly. The strategy balances risk mitigation with development efficiency, allowing for a smooth transition period.
