# Context Refactoring Tracker

This file tracks the progress of our context refactoring effort.

## Current Status

- **Phase:** 2 - Context Implementation
- **Current Task:** Implemented AuthContext and ModelContext - COMPLETED
- **Next Phase:** Phase 3 - Refactoring SessionContext and ThemeContext
- **Last Updated:** Sunday April 27, 2025

## Progress Overview

- ✅ Analyzed current context structure and dependencies
- ✅ Documented current issues and created architecture plan
- ✅ Created utility service files
  - ✅ apiService.js - API interaction functions
  - ✅ storageService.js - localStorage interaction
  - ✅ logger.js enhancements - Added performance tracking and more features
- ✅ Implemented AuthContext fully
  - ✅ Moved auth functions from SessionContext
  - ✅ Updated use-auth hook
  - ✅ Used utility services for API and storage operations
- ✅ Implemented ModelContext fully
  - ✅ Moved model management from SessionContext
  - ✅ Updated use-model hook
  - ✅ Used utility services for API and storage operations
- ✅ Updated App.jsx with proper context hierarchy
  - ✅ ThemeProvider → AuthProvider → ModelProvider → SessionProvider

## Next Steps

1. Refactor SessionContext
   - Remove redundant auth and model functionality
   - Update references to use the new contexts
   - Implement use of utility services
2. Update ThemeContext
   - Ensure it fully uses the utility services
   - Consolidate theme-related functions

## Notes & Observations

- SessionContext is extremely overloaded (400+ lines)
- We have circular dependencies between Theme and Session contexts
- We already have partial implementations of AuthContext and ModelContext that aren't being used
- We need to establish a clear hierarchical relationship between contexts

## Risks & Mitigation

- **Risk:** Breaking existing functionality during refactoring
  - **Mitigation:** Implement one context at a time, with thorough testing

- **Risk:** Introducing new circular dependencies
  - **Mitigation:** Carefully plan context hierarchy and data flow

- **Risk:** Inconsistent state during transitions
  - **Mitigation:** Add detailed logging and state transition validation
