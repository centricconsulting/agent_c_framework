# Context Refactoring Tracker

This file tracks the progress of our context refactoring effort.

## Current Status

- **Phase:** 3 - Context Implementation Complete
- **Current Task:** Refactored SessionContext and standardized hooks - COMPLETED
- **Next Phase:** Phase 4 - Component Updates and Testing
- **Last Updated:** Sunday April 27, 2025 (most recent update)

## Progress Overview

- ✅ Analyzed current context structure and dependencies
- ✅ Documented current issues and created architecture plan
- ✅ Created utility service files
  - ✅ apiService.js - API interaction functions
  - ✅ storageService.js - localStorage interaction
  - ✅ logger.js enhancements - Added performance tracking and more features
- ✅ Implemented AuthContext fully
  - ✅ Moved auth functions from SessionContext
  - ✅ Updated use-auth hook
  - ✅ Used utility services for API and storage operations
- ✅ Implemented ModelContext fully
  - ✅ Moved model management from SessionContext
  - ✅ Updated use-model hook
  - ✅ Used utility services for API and storage operations
- ✅ Updated App.jsx with proper context hierarchy
  - ✅ ThemeProvider → AuthProvider → ModelProvider → SessionProvider
- ✅ Refactored SessionContext fully
  - ✅ Removed redundant auth and model functionality
  - ✅ Updated internal references to use the new contexts
  - ✅ Implemented use of utility services
  - ✅ Updated use-session-context hook
- ✅ Standardized hook implementations
  - ✅ Updated useTheme hook to match pattern
  - ✅ Removed duplicate hook in ThemeContext.jsx
  - ✅ Standardized import paths with @ alias

## Next Steps

1. Update components to use the appropriate contexts
   - Update components that use SessionContext for auth to use useAuth directly
   - Update components that use SessionContext for model to use useModel directly
   - Update components that use SessionContext for theme to use useTheme directly

2. Comprehensive testing
   - Test login/logout functionality
   - Test model selection and configuration
   - Test theme switching
   - Test chat interactions
   - Test file uploads and management

## Notes & Observations

- SessionContext is extremely overloaded (400+ lines)
- We have circular dependencies between Theme and Session contexts
- We already have partial implementations of AuthContext and ModelContext that aren't being used
- We need to establish a clear hierarchical relationship between contexts

## Risks & Mitigation

- **Risk:** Breaking existing functionality during refactoring
  - **Mitigation:** Implement one context at a time, with thorough testing

- **Risk:** Introducing new circular dependencies
  - **Mitigation:** Carefully plan context hierarchy and data flow

- **Risk:** Inconsistent state during transitions
  - **Mitigation:** Add detailed logging and state transition validation
