# Context Refactoring Tracker

This file tracks the progress of our context refactoring effort.

## Current Status

- **Phase:** 1 - Preparation
- **Current Task:** Create utility service files - COMPLETED
- **Last Updated:** Sunday April 27, 2025

## Progress Overview

- ✅ Analyzed current context structure and dependencies
- ✅ Documented current issues and created architecture plan
- ✅ Created utility service files
  - ✅ apiService.js - API interaction functions
  - ✅ storageService.js - localStorage interaction
  - ✅ logger.js enhancements - Added performance tracking and more features

## Next Steps

1. Implement AuthContext fully
   - Move auth functions from SessionContext
   - Create use-auth hook
   - Update components to use the new AuthContext
2. Implement ModelContext fully
   - Move model management from SessionContext
   - Create use-model hook
   - Update components to use the new ModelContext

## Notes & Observations

- SessionContext is extremely overloaded (400+ lines)
- We have circular dependencies between Theme and Session contexts
- We already have partial implementations of AuthContext and ModelContext that aren't being used
- We need to establish a clear hierarchical relationship between contexts

## Risks & Mitigation

- **Risk:** Breaking existing functionality during refactoring
  - **Mitigation:** Implement one context at a time, with thorough testing

- **Risk:** Introducing new circular dependencies
  - **Mitigation:** Carefully plan context hierarchy and data flow

- **Risk:** Inconsistent state during transitions
  - **Mitigation:** Add detailed logging and state transition validation
