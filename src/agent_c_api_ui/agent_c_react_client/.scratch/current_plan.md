# ShadCN and Radix UI Implementation Plan

## Overall Strategy

This document outlines our multi-session plan to correct the implementation of shadcn/ui and Radix UI components in the application. The approach focuses on minimizing disruption while systematically improving the codebase.

## Phase 1: Assessment and Planning

### Goals
- Complete inventory of all components
- Identify critical issues and priorities
- Create detailed implementation plan
- Establish CSS variable mapping

### Tasks
1. ✅ Audit shadcn/ui components in src/components/ui
2. ✅ Examine application components using shadcn/ui
3. ✅ Analyze theming systems and CSS structure
4. ✅ Create component analysis documentation
5. ✅ Develop CSS variable mapping between systems
6. ✅ Prioritize components for migration

## Phase 2: Fix Critical Issues

### Goals
- Fix broken components and incorrect imports
- Address theming inconsistencies
- Ensure dark mode works correctly

### Tasks
1. Fix ThemeToggle component import paths
2. Correct CSS import structure in main.css/component-styles.css
3. Ensure dark mode toggles properly with both theming systems
4. Address any visual bugs in core UI components

## Phase 3: Standardize Core Components

### Goals
- Ensure all shadcn/ui components follow best practices
- Standardize usage patterns across application
- Consolidate theming variables

### Tasks
1. Review and fix shadcn/ui components against documentation
2. Standardize implementation of Radix primitives
3. Begin migration of custom CSS to shadcn/ui variables
4. Create component usage documentation

## Phase 4: Application Component Migration

### Goals
- Migrate application components to use shadcn/ui properly
- Remove duplicate and inline styles
- Ensure consistent styling across the application

### Tasks
1. Prioritize high-visibility components for migration
2. Move inline styles to CSS files following shadcn pattern
3. Replace custom CSS classes with Tailwind where appropriate
4. Test components in both light and dark modes

## Phase 5: Theming Consolidation

### Goals
- Fully transition to shadcn/ui theming system
- Remove legacy custom theme variables
- Ensure consistent look and feel throughout the application

### Tasks
1. Create comprehensive mapping between theme systems
2. Replace custom theme variable usage with shadcn equivalents
3. Update component CSS files to use shadcn variables
4. Remove duplicate variables from variables.css

## Phase 6: Final Testing and Documentation

### Goals
- Ensure application functions correctly with new styling
- Document theming system and component usage
- Provide guidelines for future development

### Tasks
1. Comprehensive visual testing across all components
2. Ensure dark mode functions properly throughout
3. Document theming approach and variables
4. Create component styling guidelines for future development
