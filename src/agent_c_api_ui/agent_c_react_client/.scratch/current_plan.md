# ShadCN and Radix UI Improvement Plan

## Current Status
- Completed initial exploration
- Identified key issues in component implementation
- Documented current state in component_analysis.md

## Overall Goals

2. Verify correct implementation of Radix UI primitives
3. Standardize CSS organization and implementation
4. Fix any inconsistencies in theming
5. Ensure proper light/dark mode support

## High-Level Plan

### Phase 1: Investigation and Documentation
1. ✅ Analyze the current codebase structure and component implementation
2. ✅ Document the existing theming system and identify inconsistencies
3. Review all shadcn/ui components for correctness
4. Review custom components that should be using shadcn/ui
5. Analyze CSS files for duplication and inconsistencies
6. Create a detailed inventory of all UI components used in the application

### Phase 2: Standardization Planning
1. Define a consistent approach for component styling
2. Create a plan for consolidating the theming systems
3. Prioritize components for migration/correction
4. Establish CSS organization standards
5. Document a path for addressing inline styles

### Phase 3: Implementation
1. Fix shadcn/ui component imports and implementation
2. Standardize the theming system

2. Check for custom components that could be replaced with shadcn/ui
3. Create a comprehensive inventory of all component CSS files
4. Analyze the most used components for styling inconsistencies

## Completed Actions
- ✅ Initial analysis of codebase structure
- ✅ Documentation of components.json configuration
- ✅ Analysis of theming systems
