# Current Implementation Plan: Phase 5 Secondary Components

## Overview
After successfully completing Phase 4 of the UI standardization project focusing on high-priority chat interface components, we are now moving to Phase 5 which focuses on secondary chat interface components. These components provide additional functionality and configuration options to the main chat interface.

## Components in Scope for Phase 5
1. PersonaSelector.jsx (u2705 Complete)
2. CollapsibleOptions.jsx (ud83dudd04 In Progress)
3. StatusBar.jsx (Planned)
4. ModelParameterControls.jsx (Planned)
5. TokenUsageDisplay.jsx (Planned)
6. ExportHTMLButton.jsx (Planned)

## Current Focus: ModelParameterControls.jsx
With StatusBar.jsx now standardized, we are moving on to the ModelParameterControls component. We'll analyze its current implementation and create a standardization plan focusing on accessibility, responsive design, and dark mode support.

### Completed: StatusBar.jsx
We've successfully standardized the StatusBar component with the following improvements:
1. Added ARIA attributes for better accessibility and screen reader support
2. Enhanced the responsive design with proper mobile breakpoints
3. Improved dark mode support with specific styles
4. Added PropTypes validation
5. Enhanced keyboard navigation with proper focus states
6. Updated JSDoc documentation

### Completed: CollapsibleOptions.jsx
We've successfully standardized the CollapsibleOptions component with the following improvements:
1. Added ARIA labels and attributes for better accessibility
2. Updated CSS to improve mobile responsiveness
3. Enhanced dark mode styles for better contrast
4. Added keyboard navigation improvements with focus styles
5. Added proper PropTypes validation
6. Updated prop documentation to match actual usage

## Next Steps
After completing the CollapsibleOptions component, we will move on to the StatusBar component, followed by ModelParameterControls, TokenUsageDisplay, and ExportHTMLButton.

## Progress Tracking
Progress is being tracked in the `phase5_task_tracker.md` file in the scratchpad. This document will be updated as tasks are completed.
