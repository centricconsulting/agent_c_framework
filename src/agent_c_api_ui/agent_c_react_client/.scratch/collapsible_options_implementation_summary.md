# CollapsibleOptions Component Implementation Summary

## Overview
The CollapsibleOptions component has been standardized according to shadcn/ui patterns. This component serves as a container for settings and tool selection, using tabs to organize these features. It was already effectively using shadcn/ui components, so our focus was on enhancing accessibility, responsive design, and ensuring consistent documentation.

## Key Improvements

### Accessibility Enhancements
- Added ARIA attributes throughout the component:
  - `role="region"` and `aria-label` for the card
  - `aria-expanded` for the collapsible component
  - `aria-label` and `aria-controls` for buttons
  - Added screen reader text for toggle button
  - Properly associated tabs with their content

### CSS Improvements
- Enhanced the CSS organization with clear sections
- Added responsive styles for mobile devices with appropriate spacing
- Added specific dark mode styles for better contrast
- Improved focus styles for better keyboard navigation
- Added CSS variables for consistent spacing on mobile

### Documentation
- Updated JSDoc comments to accurately reflect props usage
- Improved descriptions of each prop with more details
- Clarified the relationship between this component and its children

### Code Quality
- Added PropTypes validation for all props
- Ensured consistent naming of CSS classes
- Used the cn utility for conditional class names

## Component Structure
The component maintains its original structure using shadcn/ui components:
- Card as the container
- Collapsible for the expand/collapse functionality
- Tabs for organizing settings and tools sections
- Integrated with PersonaSelector and ToolSelector components

## CSS Organization
The CSS file follows the standardized format with:
- Clear component header and description
- Base styles section
- Animation styles section
- Focus styles for keyboard navigation
- Dark mode specific styles
- Responsive styles with media queries

## Accessibility Testing
- Verified keyboard navigation works as expected
- Ensured screen readers announce state changes
- Confirmed sufficient color contrast in both light and dark modes

This standardization brings the CollapsibleOptions component in line with the project's accessibility and design standards while maintaining its functionality.
