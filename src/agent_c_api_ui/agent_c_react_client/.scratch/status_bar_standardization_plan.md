# StatusBar Component Standardization Plan

## Current Analysis

- The StatusBar component displays system status information, active tools, and export options
- It's already using shadcn/ui components (Card, Button, Badge, Tooltip)
- It includes CopyButton and ExportHTMLButton components for exporting chat content
- It has a well-structured CSS file with good organization and descriptive classes

## Improvements Needed

1. Add proper ARIA attributes for better accessibility
2. Improve mobile responsiveness (esp. for smaller screens)
3. Enhance dark mode support
4. Add PropTypes validation
5. Update class naming to be more consistent with shadcn/ui patterns
6. Ensure properly structured JSX with proper semantics

## Implementation Steps

1. Add ARIA attributes to status indicator, tooltips, and action buttons
2. Update CSS for better mobile responsiveness
3. Add dark mode specific styles
4. Add PropTypes validation
5. Update class names to better align with shadcn/ui patterns
6. Add keyboard navigation improvements

## Expected Outcomes

- Improved accessibility with proper ARIA attributes
- Better mobile experience with responsive layout
- Enhanced dark mode support
- Proper PropTypes validation
- More consistent class naming across the application
- Better keyboard navigation
