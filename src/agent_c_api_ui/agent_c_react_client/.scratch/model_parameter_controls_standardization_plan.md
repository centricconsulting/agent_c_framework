# ModelParameterControls Standardization Plan

## Current Analysis
The ModelParameterControls component is a complex component that allows users to adjust AI model parameters including temperature, reasoning effort, and extended thinking settings. It uses several shadcn/ui components (Label, Slider, Switch, Select) and has its own CSS file with good organization.

## Issues to Address
1. Accessibility: Lacks sufficient ARIA attributes for screen readers
2. Mobile responsiveness: No specific adjustments for small screens
3. Dark mode contrast: Could use better visual contrast in dark mode
4. Keyboard navigation: Needs improvements for better keyboard navigation
5. PropTypes: Missing PropTypes validation

## Standardization Steps

### 1. Enhance Accessibility
- Add aria-labelledby attributes to connect labels with controls
- Add aria-valuenow, aria-valuemin, aria-valuemax to sliders
- Add role="group" with aria-labelledby for grouped controls
- Add descriptive aria-label attributes where needed

### 2. Improve Mobile Responsiveness
- Add media queries for small screens
- Adjust spacing and font sizes for mobile devices
- Ensure touch targets are large enough (min 44px)

### 3. Enhance Dark Mode Support
- Check contrast in dark mode
- Add specific dark mode variables for better visibility
- Ensure all elements have proper contrast ratios

### 4. Improve Keyboard Navigation
- Add focus styles to all interactive elements
- Ensure logical tab order
- Add keyboard support for custom controls

### 5. Add PropTypes Validation
- Add PropTypes for all props
- Document required vs optional props

### 6. Documentation
- Update JSDoc comments for clarity
- Add component description header
- Document state management approaches

## CSS Improvements
- Add responsive styles with media queries
- Add dark mode specific styles
- Add focus and keyboard navigation styles
- Standardize variable usage
