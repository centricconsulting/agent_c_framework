# SessionContext Analysis Plan

## Approach

1. First, examine the SessionContext.jsx file itself to understand its structure, state, and methods
2. Then examine all 33 components in chat_interface directory to understand how they use SessionContext
3. Create a detailed map of all dependencies between components and context
4. Identify logical groupings of functionality that would make sense as separate contexts
5. Develop a gradual refactoring plan that minimizes risk

## Components to Analyze

### Main Components (31) - COMPLETED
- [x] AgentConfigDisplay.jsx
- [x] AgentConfigHoverCard.jsx
- [x] AnimatedStatusIndicator.jsx
- [x] AssistantMessage.jsx
- [x] ChatInputArea.jsx
- [x] ChatInterface.jsx
- [x] CollapsibleOptions.jsx
- [x] CopyButton.jsx (Low dependency - UI helper component)
- [x] DragDropArea.jsx
- [x] DragDropOverlay.jsx (Low dependency - UI helper component)

- [x] UserMessage.jsx

### Utils (2) - COMPLETED
- [x] utils/htmlChatFormatter.jsx
- [x] utils/MessageStreamProcessor.js

## Analysis Criteria for Each Component

1. **State Variables Used**: Which SessionContext state variables are consumed
2. **Functions Called**: Which SessionContext functions are invoked
3. **State Updates**: How the component updates SessionContext state
4. **API Interactions**: How the component triggers API calls through context
5. **Dependencies**: Other components it depends on
6. **Impact of Refactoring**: How it would be affected by context changes

## Progress Tracking - COMPLETED

All components have been analyzed and documented. The analysis reveals that while some components are heavily dependent on SessionContext, many others have minimal or no direct dependencies.

### Analysis Documents Created

- `session_context_analysis.md`: Initial analysis of SessionContext
- `session_context_usage.md`: Detailed analysis of each component's usage of SessionContext
- `session_context_issues.md`: Specific issues and challenges with the current implementation
- `session_context_dashboard.md`: High-level summary of findings and recommendations
- `session_context_refactoring_plan.md`: Comprehensive plan for refactoring the context
- `phase1_api_service_plan.md`: Detailed implementation plan for Phase 1 (API Service Layer)
- `session_context_next_steps.md`: Executive summary and next steps

The analysis is now complete, and we can proceed with implementing the refactoring plan.
