# ChatInterface Fix Implementation Plan

## Problem Statement

The ChatInterface.jsx component isn't properly using the standardized components we've developed. Most notably:

1. It's not using our dedicated ChatInputArea component for the input section
2. It's not properly utilizing our MessagesList and specialized message type components
3. The styling is inconsistent as a result

## Implementation Plan

1. Replace the current ChatInterface.jsx implementation with our standardized version

2. Adjust any necessary imports or component references

3. Verify that the ChatInputArea component is properly integrated

4. Ensure all message types are correctly styled and rendered

## Implementation Details

1. **Update ChatInterface.jsx**:
   - Replace the current implementation with our standardized version from `//ui/.scratch/trash/standardized_chat_interface.jsx`
   - Ensure all necessary imports are present
   - Check for any updates needed based on recent changes to the API

2. **Verify Integration**:
   - Make sure ChatInputArea is properly imported and used
   - Ensure MessageItem and MessagesList correctly handle all message types
   - Confirm styling is applied consistently
