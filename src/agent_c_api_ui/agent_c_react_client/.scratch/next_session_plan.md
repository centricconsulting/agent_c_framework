   - Pay special attention to the interactivity and streaming functionality
   - Ensure all tool calls work correctly with our standardized components
   - Verify dark mode styling is consistent

2. **ToolSelector Integration**:
   - Ensure it works with the standardized components we've already created
   - Verify proper function of tool selection and display
   - Check compatibility with the FileUploadManager

3. **Core Component Standardization**:
