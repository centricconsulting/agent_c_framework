# Next Session Plan: Implementing MessagesList and Analyzing FilesPanel

## Progress Update
We've successfully analyzed the MessagesList component and created a standardized prototype. We've also fixed import path issues in the shadcn/ui sidebar component, and we've successfully implemented the standardized AppSidebar, Layout, and PageHeader components.

## Overview
In our next session, we'll implement the standardized MessagesList component and begin analyzing the FilesPanel component, which is used to display uploaded files in the chat interface.

## Tasks

### Phase 1: Implement Standardized MessagesList Component

1. **Implement MessagesList Component**
   - Replace the current MessagesList component with our standardized version
   - Update the messages-list.css file with our simplified CSS
   - Update import paths if needed
   - Ensure proper integration with MessageItem component

2. **Test Implementation**
   - Test with different types of messages
   - Verify scrolling and animation behavior
   - Test in both light and dark modes
   - Ensure responsiveness across screen sizes

### Phase 2: Analyze FilesPanel Component

1. **Analyze FilesPanel Component**
   - Review the existing implementation and structure
   - Identify issues with styling, component organization, and theme integration
   - Document current functionality and limitations
   - Create a component analysis document

2. **Analyze Related Components**
   - Review the FileItem component and its relationship with FilesPanel
   - Analyze the DragDropArea and DragDropOverlay components
   - Document dependencies and requirements

### Phase 3: Create Standardized Prototype for FilesPanel

1. **Create FilesPanel Prototype**
   - Create a standardized prototype in the scratchpad
   - Implement proper shadcn/ui components and Tailwind classes
   - Address any issues identified during analysis
   - Ensure proper theme integration and responsiveness

2. **Create CSS for FilesPanel**
   - Create a standardized CSS file for the component
   - Use shadcn/ui theme variables consistently
   - Implement responsive behavior
   - Ensure proper styling for file items and drag-drop areas

## Success Criteria

1. MessagesList component is fully standardized and working
2. All message types display correctly
3. Scrolling and animation behavior works properly
4. Theme switching works correctly with all components
5. No regressions in existing functionality
6. CSS is clean, organized, and follows our standards

## Next Steps After This Session

1. Continue analyzing and standardizing remaining UI components
2. Continue CSS variable standardization across the application
3. Begin work on the FilesPanel component
4. Continue implementation of standardized versions of other analyzed components
