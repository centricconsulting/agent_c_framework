# Next Session Implementation Plan

## Focus Areas

1. **ChatInterface Analysis**
   - Analyze the ChatInterface component structure
   - Identify parts that can be standardized with shadcn/ui
   - Create a prototype for the standardized ChatInterface
   - Focus on how it integrates with the standardized components we've already created

2. **ToolSelector Analysis**
   - Analyze the ToolSelector component
   - Identify how it can be standardized with shadcn/ui components
   - Create a prototype for the standardized ToolSelector

3. **Continuing Component Standardization**
   - Analyze any remaining critical UI components
   - Finalize the implementation of CSS restructuring
   - Begin implementing standardized versions of shadcn/ui core components

## Immediate Next Steps

1. Begin analysis of the ChatInterface component
2. Document findings in the component analysis document
3. Create a prototype for the ChatInterface
4. Analyze the ToolSelector component
5. Create a prototype for the ToolSelector 

## Considerations

1. **ChatInterface Complexity**:
   - ChatInterface is a complex component with many moving parts
   - It may need to be broken down into smaller components
   - Focus on identifying which parts can be standardized with shadcn/ui

2. **ToolSelector Integration**:
   - Ensure it works with the standardized components we've already created
   - Verify proper function of tool selection and display
   - Check compatibility with the FileUploadManager

3. **Tailwind Migration**:
   - Continue focusing on moving from custom CSS to Tailwind utilities
   - Ensure proper dark mode handling with Tailwind's dark: variant
   - Document all CSS class to Tailwind utility mappings

## Success Criteria

1. ChatInterface is thoroughly analyzed and a prototype is created
2. ToolSelector is analyzed and a prototype is created
3. All components still function correctly in both light and dark mode
4. Code is more maintainable and follows shadcn/ui best practices
