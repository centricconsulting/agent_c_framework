# Next Session Implementation Plan

## Focus Areas

Based on our analysis and the progress we've made so far, the next session should focus on:

1. Implementing the CSS import restructuring plan
2. Standardizing more shadcn/ui components
3. Creating a comprehensive component audit spreadsheet

## Detailed Tasks

### 1. CSS Import Restructuring

- [x] Update index.css to improve import order:
  - ✅ Tailwind base/components first
  - ✅ Common styles imported via main.css
  - ✅ Tailwind utilities last

- [x] Simplify main.css:
  - ✅ Remove duplicate imports
  - ✅ Remove import of component-styles.css

- [x] Add deprecation notice to component-styles.css
  - ✅ Added clear notice that the file will be removed in a future update

- [x] Test thoroughly after changes:
  - ✅ Verified light and dark mode functionality
  - ✅ Confirmed theme toggle works properly

### 2. Component Standardization

Select 2-3 shadcn/ui components to fully standardize and verify:

- [ ] Button component
  - Compare to latest shadcn/ui documentation
  - Test all variants and sizes
  - Ensure proper light/dark theming

- [ ] Dialog component
  - Verify against latest shadcn/ui docs
  - Test all features (open, close, animations)
  - Ensure proper accessibility

- [ ] Card component
  - Check against latest shadcn/ui docs
  - Test variants and composition

### 3. Component Inventory

- [ ] Create a comprehensive component inventory spreadsheet with:
  - Component name
  - File path
  - Type (shadcn, custom, needs migration)
  - Styling approach (CSS file, Tailwind, inline)
  - Priority for migration
  - Notes on issues

- [ ] Inventory at least 10 key application components:
  - Layout.jsx
  - MarkdownMessage.jsx
  - ChatInputArea.jsx
  - And 7 others based on visibility and importance

### 4. Implementation of Theming Improvements

- [ ] Test theme toggle functionality thoroughly
- [ ] Document how the current theme state is managed
- [ ] Create a prototype for a unified theming approach

## Deliverables

By the end of the next session, we should have:

1. Improved CSS import structure
2. 2-3 fully verified shadcn/ui components
3. Component inventory of at least 10 key components
4. Better understanding of the theming system
5. Documentation of current state and next steps

## Testing Approach

For each change made:

1. Verify in both light and dark modes
2. Test responsive behavior on different screen sizes
3. Check for any visual regressions in styling
4. Ensure component functionality remains intact
