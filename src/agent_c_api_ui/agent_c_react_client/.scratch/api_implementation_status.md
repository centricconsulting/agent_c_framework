# API Implementation Status Tracker

## Current Status (as of May 10, 2025 4:25PM EDT)

**Current Phase:** Phase 2
**Current Step:** Step 1 - Create Config API Service (Completed)
**Previous Step:** Phase 1, Step 1 - Update API Base (Completed)
**Next Step:** Phase 2, Step 2 - Create History API Service

## Phase 1: Base Infrastructure and Utility Functions

- [x] **Step 1:** Update API Base (Completed May 10, 2025)
  - [x] Updated API base URL to `/api/v2`
  - [x] Added `extractResponseData` utility function
  - [x] Enhanced error handling for v2 API format
  - [x] Added support for pagination in GET requests
  - [x] Added PATCH method to support RESTful updates

## Phase 2: New API Services

- [x] **Step 1:** Create Config API Service (Completed May 10, 2025)
  - [x] Created `config-api.js` for all configuration endpoints
  - [x] Implemented `getModels()`, `getPersonas()`, `getTools()` and `getSystemConfig()`
  - [x] Added additional utility methods like `getModelDetails`, `getPersonaDetails`, etc.
  - [x] Added test file for Config API Service
  - [x] Updated `index.js` to export the new service

## Upcoming Tasks

- [ ] **Step 2:** Create History API Service (Next Task)
  - [ ] Create `history-api.js` for history and replay endpoints
  - [ ] Implement methods for listing, retrieving, and streaming events
  - [ ] Implement replay control methods
  - [ ] Add tests for History API Service

- [ ] **Step 3:** Create Debug API Service

### Phase 3: Update Existing Services

- [ ] **Step 1:** Update Session API Service
- [ ] **Step 2:** Update Chat API Service
- [ ] **Step 3:** Update index.js

## Notes & Considerations

- The v2 API uses standardized response format with `data`, `meta`, and `errors` fields
- The extractResponseData utility makes it easy to handle this format consistently
- Error handling has been enhanced to provide more detailed error information
- All endpoints now follow RESTful conventions more closely
- Config API now includes a new `getSystemConfig()` method that retrieves all configuration in one call

## Potential Issues & Mitigations

- **Issue:** Components expecting v1 response formats
  - **Mitigation:** We'll create adapter functions in Phase 4

- **Issue:** Parallel testing of both API versions
  - **Mitigation:** We'll use separate test suites for v1 and v2

- **Issue:** Method name conflicts between old and new APIs
  - **Mitigation:** Using aliases for exports (e.g., `getModelDetails as getConfigModelDetails`)
