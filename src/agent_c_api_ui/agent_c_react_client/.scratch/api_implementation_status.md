# API Implementation Status Tracker

## Current Status (as of May 10, 2025 6:45PM EDT)

**Current Phase:** Phase 2 - Completed
**Current Step:** Step 3 - Create Debug API Service (Completed)
**Previous Step:** Phase 2, Step 2 - Create History API Service (Completed)
**Next Step:** Phase 3, Step 1 - Update Session API Service

## Phase 1: Base Infrastructure and Utility Functions

- [x] **Step 1:** Update API Base (Completed May 10, 2025)
  - [x] Updated API base URL to `/api/v2`
  - [x] Added `extractResponseData` utility function
  - [x] Enhanced error handling for v2 API format
  - [x] Added support for pagination in GET requests
  - [x] Added PATCH method to support RESTful updates

## Phase 2: New API Services

- [x] **Step 1:** Create Config API Service (Completed May 10, 2025)
  - [x] Created `config-api.js` for all configuration endpoints
  - [x] Implemented `getModels()`, `getPersonas()`, `getTools()` and `getSystemConfig()`
  - [x] Added additional utility methods like `getModelDetails`, `getPersonaDetails`, etc.
  - [x] Added test file for Config API Service
  - [x] Updated `index.js` to export the new service

- [x] **Step 2:** Create History API Service (Completed May 10, 2025)
  - [x] Created `history-api.js` for history and replay endpoints
  - [x] Implemented methods for listing, retrieving, and streaming events
  - [x] Implemented replay control methods
  - [x] Added tests for History API Service
  - [x] Updated `index.js` to export the new service

- [x] **Step 3:** Create Debug API Service (Completed May 10, 2025)
  - [x] Created `debug-api.js` for debugging endpoints
  - [x] Implemented session and agent debug information methods
  - [x] Added tests for Debug API Service
  - [x] Verified it's properly exported in services index file

## Upcoming Tasks

### Phase 3: Update Existing Services

- [ ] **Step 1:** Update Session API Service (Next Task)
  - [ ] Update `session-api.js` for v2 session endpoints
  - [ ] Update session creation, verification, listing, and deletion methods
  - [ ] Add agent configuration methods
  - [ ] Update tool management methods
  - [ ] Add tests for updated Session API Service

- [ ] **Step 2:** Update Chat API Service
- [ ] **Step 3:** Update index.js

## Notes & Considerations

- The v2 API uses standardized response format with `data`, `meta`, and `errors` fields
- The extractResponseData utility makes it easy to handle this format consistently
- Error handling has been enhanced to provide more detailed error information
- All endpoints now follow RESTful conventions more closely
- History API includes event streaming support using the EventSource API for server-sent events (SSE)

## Implementation Details

### Debug API

The Debug API service provides the following capabilities:

- **Session Debug Info:** Retrieve comprehensive debugging information about a session's state, including session identifiers, agent configuration, message statistics, and component status.
- **Agent Debug Info:** Get detailed information about an agent's configuration parameters, including bridge parameters, internal agent parameters, and runtime settings.

The implementation follows the same patterns as other services, with proper error handling and response data extraction. Tests cover the major success and error scenarios.

### History API

The History API service provides the following capabilities:

- **List Histories:** Retrieve a paginated list of session histories
- **History Details:** Get detailed information about a specific session history
- **Event Retrieval:** Get events for a session with filtering options
- **Event Streaming:** Real-time event streaming using Server-Sent Events (SSE)
- **Replay Controls:** Play, pause, and seek through a session replay

The implementation includes comprehensive error handling and follows the established patterns.

## Potential Issues & Mitigations

- **Issue:** Components expecting v1 response formats
  - **Mitigation:** We'll create adapter functions in Phase 4

- **Issue:** Parallel testing of both API versions
  - **Mitigation:** We'll use separate test suites for v1 and v2

- **Issue:** Method name conflicts between old and new APIs
  - **Mitigation:** Using aliases for exports (e.g., `getModelDetails as getConfigModelDetails`)
