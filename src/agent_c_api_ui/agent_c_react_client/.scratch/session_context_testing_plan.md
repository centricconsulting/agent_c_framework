# SessionContext Refactoring Testing Plan

## Testing Goals

1. Ensure the refactored SessionContext works as expected
2. Verify proper integration with other contexts
3. Detect any regressions in component behavior
4. Check for any performance issues

## Testing Areas

### 1. Basic Context Loading

- Verify that SessionContext loads without errors
- Check that context variables are initialized with expected defaults
- Confirm that initial API calls (personas, tools) are made

### 2. Integration with Other Contexts

- Verify AuthContext provides sessionId to SessionContext
- Verify ModelContext provides model information to SessionContext
- Test interaction between different contexts (e.g., model changes, auth changes)

### 3. Component Compatibility

**ChatInterface.jsx**:
- Verify ChatInterface properly consumes SessionContext
- Test streaming, loading state
- Check that messages are properly managed
- Test tool handling functionality

**SidebarCommandMenu.jsx**:
- Verify commands related to SessionContext still work
- Test copy operations (getChatCopyContent, getChatCopyHTML)

### 4. Chat Functionality

- Verify message list and chat state management
- Test persona switching
- Test tool selection and equipping
- Test copy/paste operations
- Test streaming behavior

### 5. Performance

- Check load times for initial data
- Verify API calls are properly using apiService
- Check for duplicate API calls

## Testing Approach

### Manual Testing

1. **Development Server Testing**:
   - Run the app locally with the refactored code
   - Walk through user flows to ensure functionality
   - Check console for errors and logging

2. **Edge Case Testing**:
   - Test with session already established
   - Test with no session
   - Test with network errors
   - Test without model selection

3. **Cross-browser Testing**:
   - Test in Chrome, Firefox, Safari
   - Verify localStorage operations work in all browsers

### Logging-Based Verification

1. Add logging statements at critical points:
   - On context initialization
   - When API calls are made
   - When state changes
   - When errors occur

2. Create a log aggregation approach:
   - Console output for developer visibility
   - Potential log storage for analysis

### Integration Testing

1. Create an integration test setup that verifies:
   - Context initialization order
   - Context interactions
   - Component rendering with the full context hierarchy

## Rollback Plan

In case of issues, we should maintain a backup of the original SessionContext implementation. If significant problems are detected, revert to the original and address issues before attempting refactoring again.

## Success Criteria

The refactoring is considered successful when:

1. All tests pass without errors
2. No regression in functionality is observed
3. SessionContext is focused on chat-specific concerns
4. Components interacting with SessionContext continue to work as expected
5. Improved code organization and maintainability is achieved
