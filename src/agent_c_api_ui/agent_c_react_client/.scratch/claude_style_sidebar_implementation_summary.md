# Claude-Style Sidebar Implementation Summary

## Requirements
- Create a sidebar toggle similar to Claude's interface
- Have "Agent C" title on the same line as the toggle button
- Make the title disappear when the sidebar is minimized
- Keep the icons visible in collapsed state

## Implementation Changes

### 1. AppSidebar.jsx
- Moved `SidebarTrigger` into the same line as the "Agent C" title
- Restructured the sidebar header to have the toggle and title in a row
- Added `sidebar-title` class to the title elements for CSS control
- Applied the same class to the footer text to maintain consistency

### 2. app-sidebar.css
- Updated `.sidebar-logo` to use a row layout instead of column
- Added `.sidebar-title` styles with transitions for smooth appearance/disappearance
- Added specific rules to hide the title when sidebar is collapsed
- Added rules to center the menu icons when sidebar is collapsed
- Improved transitions for a more polished feel

### 3. Behavior
- In expanded state: Full sidebar with icons and text
- In collapsed state: Icon-only sidebar with centered icons and no text
- Mobile: Sheet-based sidebar that slides in from the left

## Visual Appearance
- The toggle button is now inline with the "Agent C" title
- When collapsed, only icons are visible in a narrower sidebar
- Smooth transitions between states
- Content area adjusts to the sidebar width

## Benefits
- More space-efficient interface similar to modern applications
- Always-accessible navigation through the icon sidebar
- Better visual hierarchy and alignment
- More professional and polished appearance
