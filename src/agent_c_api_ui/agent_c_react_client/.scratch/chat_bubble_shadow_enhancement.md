# Chat Bubble Shadow Enhancement

## Changes Made

1. **Enhanced Shadow Variables for Dark Mode**
   - Created specific dark mode shadow variables with higher opacity values
   - Increased the shadow size and spread for better visibility in dark mode
   - Added a subtle color tint to the shadows for enhanced depth perception

2. **Applied Enhanced Shadows to Message Components**
   - Updated all message bubbles to use appropriate shadow variables
   - Upgraded tool call items to use stronger `--shadow-lg` for better visibility
   - Upgraded media message cards to use stronger `--shadow-lg` for better visibility

3. **Shadow Override Implementation**
   - Added automatic shadow variable overrides in dark mode
   - Ensured the dark theme uses the enhanced shadow variables

## Technical Implementation

- Added new CSS variables for dark mode shadows with increased opacity (0.4-0.5 vs 0.2-0.3)
- Made shadows larger in dark mode to increase their visibility
- Shadow variables now automatically switch to dark-optimized versions when in dark mode
- Used `var(--shadow-lg)` instead of `var(--shadow-md)` for components that need more visual prominence

## Result

The chat bubbles now have more visible shadows in dark mode, creating better visual separation between elements and enhancing the overall depth and dimension of the UI. The shadows are stronger but still subtle enough to maintain a professional appearance.

In light mode, the shadows remain appropriate and not overpowering, while in dark mode they're now much more noticeable against the dark background.
