# Context Refactoring: Phase 4 Cleanup Plan

## Overview

After implementing the context separation refactoring, we are experiencing issues with the application not loading properly. This cleanup plan focuses on diagnosing and resolving these issues, as well as ensuring all components correctly use the new context structure.

## Objectives

1. **Diagnose loading issues** through enhanced logging and debugging
2. **Fix any circular dependencies** or initialization problems
3. **Update all components** to use the appropriate context hooks
4. **Implement robust error handling** for graceful degradation
5. **Create comprehensive tests** to verify proper operation

## Phase 4 Implementation Plan

### Stage 1: Enhanced Diagnostics (Priority: HIGH)

1. **Add Initialization Diagnostic Framework**
   - Create a global diagnostic object for tracking context initialization
   - Add initialization phases with timestamps
   - Expose diagnostics through the browser console

2. **Implement Detailed Logging**
   - Add entry/exit logging for critical initialization functions
   - Track initialization order and timing
   - Log state changes during initialization

3. **Create Error Reporting System**
   - Implement error boundaries around context providers
   - Create fallback UI for context failures
   - Add diagnostic data to error reports

### Stage 2: Fix Critical Issues (Priority: HIGH)

1. **Review Context Initialization Order**
   - Verify dependencies between contexts
   - Ensure context values are not accessed before initialized
   - Add loading states to prevent premature access

2. **Fix Any Circular Dependencies**
   - Audit import statements for circular references
   - Ensure hooks only access contexts higher in the hierarchy
   - Use React.lazy for components if needed to break cycles

3. **Resolve Race Conditions**
   - Add proper loading states to all async operations
   - Implement timeouts for API calls
   - Add retry logic for critical operations

### Stage 3: Component Updates (Priority: MEDIUM)

1. **Update ChatInterface Components**
   - Update to use specific context hooks
   - Replace references to SessionContext with appropriate hooks
   - Verify operation with the new context structure

2. **Update SidebarCommandMenu**
   - Remove any direct SessionContext dependencies
   - Implement proper theme switching using useTheme
   - Verify correct operation with auth state changes

3. **Update Layout and App Components**
   - Verify context provider hierarchy
   - Add error boundaries at appropriate levels
   - Implement loading indicators during initialization

### Stage 4: Testing and Validation (Priority: MEDIUM)

1. **Create Test Cases**
   - Loading sequence testing
   - Authentication flow testing
   - Theme switching testing
   - Model selection testing

2. **Perform Integration Testing**
   - Test full application workflows
   - Verify data consistency across context changes
   - Test error recovery scenarios

3. **Performance Testing**
   - Measure initialization time
   - Analyze render performance
   - Identify optimization opportunities

### Stage 5: Documentation and Finalization (Priority: LOW)

1. **Update Architecture Documentation**
   - Document the new context hierarchy
   - Create flow diagrams for initialization sequences
   - Document error handling and recovery procedures

2. **Create Developer Guidelines**
   - Document patterns for accessing contexts
   - Create examples of correct hook usage
   - Document diagnostic procedures

3. **Clean Up Development Artifacts**
   - Remove temporary diagnostic code
   - Optimize logging for production
   - Archive planning documents

## Risk Assessment

1. **High Risk: Initialization Order**
   - Impact: Application may fail to load
   - Mitigation: Careful sequencing and loading states

2. **Medium Risk: Component Dependencies**
   - Impact: Features may not work correctly
   - Mitigation: Comprehensive testing of each component

3. **Medium Risk: Error Recovery**
   - Impact: Poor user experience during errors
   - Mitigation: Implement fallbacks and graceful degradation

4. **Low Risk: Performance**
   - Impact: Slow initialization
   - Mitigation: Performance monitoring and optimization

## Rollback Plan

If critical issues cannot be resolved, we will implement a three-step rollback:

1. Revert to previous context structure
2. Reapply critical bug fixes to the original implementation
3. Create a more gradual migration plan with intermediate steps

During rollback, we will maintain the enhanced diagnostic framework to better understand issues for future refactoring attempts.
