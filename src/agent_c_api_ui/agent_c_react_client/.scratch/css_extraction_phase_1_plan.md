# Phase 1: CSS Extraction and Cleanup Plan

## Goals

- Create a comprehensive inventory of existing CSS styles
- Map custom CSS classes to Tailwind/shadcn/ui equivalents
- Identify components using traditional CSS vs. those already using Tailwind
- Establish a migration priority list based on component dependencies

## Steps

### 1. CSS Inventory and Analysis

- [x] Catalog all CSS files in the `/src/styles/` directory
- [x] Identify global CSS variables used throughout the application
- [x] Document common patterns and repeated styles
- [x] Identify components with the most CSS dependencies

### 2. Component Analysis

- [x] Create inventory of React components requiring migration
- [x] Categorize components by complexity and dependency relationships
- [x] Identify components already using shadcn/ui primitives
- [ ] Document prop interfaces for each component

### 3. CSS to Tailwind Mapping

- [x] Create a mapping document for common CSS patterns to Tailwind equivalents
- [x] Identify custom styles that need to be preserved as CSS variables
- [x] Document spacing, color, and typography systems currently in use
- [ ] Create a mapping for component-specific CSS classes

### 4. shadcn/ui Component Needs Assessment

- [x] Review existing shadcn/ui components already installed
- [x] Identify additional shadcn/ui components needed but not yet installed
- [x] Document component dependencies when using shadcn/ui
- [x] Create installation plan for missing shadcn/ui components

### 5. Migration Strategy Documentation

- [x] Establish a clear component migration order based on dependencies
- [x] Document approach for handling component-specific edge cases
- [x] Create a testing strategy for each migrated component
- [x] Establish guidelines for maintaining consistency during migration

## Deliverables

1. **CSS Inventory Document**: Comprehensive list of all CSS files and their purpose
2. **Component Dependency Map**: Visual or structured representation of component relationships
3. **CSS to Tailwind Migration Guide**: Mapping of CSS patterns to Tailwind equivalents
4. **shadcn/ui Component Needs Assessment**: List of components to install and their dependencies
5. **Migration Priority List**: Ordered list of components to migrate with dependency rationale

## Success Criteria

- Complete understanding of the CSS architecture
- Clear documentation of Tailwind equivalents for existing CSS
- Well-defined migration path that minimizes regressions
- Ready-to-implement plan for component migration

## Timeline

Expected completion time for Phase 1: 2-3 days of development effort
