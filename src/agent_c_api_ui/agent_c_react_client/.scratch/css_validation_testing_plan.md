# CSS Validation and Testing Plan

## Goals

- Ensure consistent styling across all migrated components
- Verify that shadcn/ui components maintain the same visual appearance as original components
- Confirm proper implementation of design system
- Validate responsive behavior across various screen sizes
- Ensure dark mode functionality works correctly

## Testing Methodology

### 1. Visual Comparison Testing

#### Before & After Screenshots
- [ ] Capture screenshots of each component before migration
- [ ] After migration, capture screenshots from the same view
- [ ] Compare screenshots to identify visual regressions

#### Responsive Breakpoint Validation
- [ ] Test each component at standard breakpoints:
  - Mobile: 320px, 375px, 425px
  - Tablet: 768px
  - Laptop: 1024px
  - Desktop: 1440px, 1920px
- [ ] Verify that responsive behavior is maintained or improved

### 2. Theme Consistency Testing

#### Light Mode Validation
- [ ] Verify colors match the design system
- [ ] Confirm text contrast meets accessibility standards
- [ ] Validate component shadows and borders

#### Dark Mode Validation
- [ ] Verify dark mode colors are correctly applied
- [ ] Confirm text contrast meets accessibility standards in dark mode
- [ ] Validate transition between light and dark modes

### 3. Functionality Testing

#### Interactive Element Testing
- [ ] Verify hover, focus, and active states
- [ ] Confirm click/tap targets are appropriately sized
- [ ] Test keyboard navigation through components

#### Animation Testing
- [ ] Verify transitions are smooth and consistent
- [ ] Confirm animations match original implementation
- [ ] Test animation performance on lower-end devices

### 4. Accessibility Testing

#### Screen Reader Compatibility
- [ ] Test with screen readers to verify accessibility
- [ ] Confirm proper ARIA attributes are preserved or improved
- [ ] Verify focus management works correctly

#### Keyboard Navigation
- [ ] Ensure all interactive elements are keyboard accessible
- [ ] Verify logical tab order through the interface
- [ ] Confirm focus indicators are visible

## Test Cases by Component Type

### Layout Components
- [ ] Verify container sizing and padding
- [ ] Confirm grid/flex layouts match original
- [ ] Test responsive behavior at breakpoints

### Input Components
- [ ] Test all input states (default, focus, disabled, error)
- [ ] Verify form validation styling
- [ ] Confirm input padding and sizing

### Display Components
- [ ] Verify text formatting and truncation
- [ ] Test content overflow handling
- [ ] Confirm image/media display

### Interactive Components
- [ ] Test all button variants and states
- [ ] Verify dropdown/menu functionality
- [ ] Confirm tooltip/popover positioning

## Documentation Requirements

### Test Documentation
- [ ] Create test report template for each component
- [ ] Document before/after screenshots in a central location
- [ ] Record any style adjustments made during testing

### Style Guide Updates
- [ ] Update style guide with new component examples
- [ ] Document theming variables and their usage
- [ ] Create pattern library of common styling solutions

## Rollout Strategy

### Phased Testing
1. Test each component individually after migration
2. Test components together in functional groups
3. Perform full application testing after migration complete

### Regression Prevention
- [ ] Create visual regression tests for key components
- [ ] Document expected behavior for future reference
- [ ] Establish CSS linting rules to maintain consistency

## Success Criteria

- All components visually match their pre-migration appearance
- Dark mode functions correctly throughout the application
- Responsive behavior works at all standard breakpoints
- No accessibility regressions introduced
- Code is cleaner, more maintainable, and follows shadcn/ui patterns
- Design system is consistently applied across all components
