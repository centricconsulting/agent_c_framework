# SessionContext Refactoring Plan

This document outlines a comprehensive plan to address the issues with SessionContext identified in our analysis. The plan is designed to be implemented across multiple sessions, with clear checkpoints and verification steps.

## Installed Packages
- ✅ loglevel - For configurable logging
- ✅ @redux-devtools/extension - For state visualization
- ✅ zustand - Lightweight state management
- ❌ @welldone-software/why-did-you-render - Skipped due to React version compatibility issues

## Phase 1: Initial Setup and Logging

### Session 1: Add Logging Infrastructure
1. Create a custom logging utility based on loglevel
2. Implement a simple render tracker using React hooks instead of why-did-you-render
3. Add strategic log points to SessionContext
4. Create a debug panel that can be toggled to view logs in the UI
5. Test and verify logging is working properly

### Session 2: Complete Analysis and Diagram Current Flow
1. Create a visual diagram of current data flow through SessionContext
2. Identify all consumers of SessionContext
3. Document all state properties and their dependencies
4. Create a proposed architecture diagram for the refactored contexts
5. Review and finalize the refactoring plan based on new insights

## Phase 2: Context Separation and Restructuring

### Session 3: Extract ThemeContext
1. Create a new ThemeContext component
2. Move theme-related state and functions from SessionContext
3. Update ThemeProvider to use the new ThemeContext
4. Update theme toggle components to use new context
5. Verify theme switching still works correctly

### Session 4: Extract AuthContext
1. Create a new AuthContext component
2. Move authentication and session management from SessionContext
3. Update components that need auth information
4. Test login/logout flows
5. Verify session persistence works correctly

### Session 5: Extract ModelContext
1. Create a new ModelContext component
2. Move model configuration and parameters from SessionContext
3. Update components that need model information
4. Test model selection and parameter adjustment
5. Verify model configuration persistence

## Phase 3: State Management Improvements

### Session 6: Extract ChatContext
1. Create a new ChatContext component
2. Move chat state management from SessionContext
3. Refactor message handling and streaming logic
4. Update ChatInterface and related components
5. Test chat functionality end-to-end

### Session 7: Extract FileContext
1. Create a new FileContext component
2. Move file upload and management code from SessionContext
3. Update file-related components
4. Test file upload and display functionality
5. Verify file management works correctly

## Phase 4: Service Layer and Storage

### Session 8: Create API Service Layer
1. Create a centralized API service
2. Move API calls from contexts into service
3. Standardize error handling and response processing
4. Update contexts to use the API service
5. Test API interactions

### Session 9: Centralize Storage Operations
1. Create a storage service for localStorage operations
2. Standardize keys and value formats
3. Add versioning to stored data
4. Update contexts to use storage service
5. Verify data persistence works correctly

## Phase 5: Finalization and Cleanup

### Session 10: Resolve Circular Dependencies
1. Review context hierarchy in App.jsx
2. Ensure contexts are provided in the correct order
3. Remove any remaining circular dependencies
4. Test the entire application for regressions
5. Verify all functionality works as expected

### Session 11: Final Cleanup and Documentation
1. Remove deprecated code and comments
2. Update documentation for the new architecture
3. Create diagrams for the new context structure
4. Add usage examples for each context
5. Final testing of the entire application

## Logging and Feedback Mechanisms

### Context State Logging
- Add a `debug` flag to each context
- When enabled, log all state changes with previous and new values
- Log which component triggered the state change
- Track render counts for context consumers

### Performance Monitoring
- Add timing measurements for key operations
- Log component mount/unmount cycles
- Track frequency of context updates
- Monitor localStorage access patterns

### Visual Debugging
- Create a togglable debug panel in the UI
- Display current state of all contexts
- Show event timeline for state changes
- Highlight components that re-render frequently

### User Feedback Collection
- Add subtle UI indicators when async operations are in progress
- Create a mechanism to report unexpected behavior directly from the UI
- Log user interactions that lead to state changes

## Success Criteria

- Each context has a single responsibility
- No circular dependencies between contexts
- Consistent state management patterns throughout the application
- Improved error handling and recovery
- Clean separation between UI, state management, and data access
- Thorough documentation of the new architecture
- No regression in functionality
- Improved performance and reliability
