# Chat Interface Component Fix

## Overview

We identified an issue with the ChatInterface.jsx component not properly using our standardized components, particularly the ChatInputArea and message-specific components. This was causing styling regressions and inconsistent visual appearance.

## Changes Made

1. **ChatInterface.jsx**:
   - ✅ Replaced the implementation with our standardized version
   - ✅ Updated to properly use the ChatInputArea component
   - ✅ Ensured all message display is delegated to MessagesList and MessageItem
   - ✅ Added proper badge display for selected files
   - ✅ Fixed separators in the options panel

## Benefits

- Consistent styling for all message types
- Proper application of CSS variables for theming
- Better separation of concerns between components
- Improved maintainability

## Related Components

- ChatInputArea
- MessagesList
- MessageItem
- AssistantMessage, UserMessage, SystemMessage, etc.

## Next Steps

Monitor for any styling regressions and address them immediately. If other components need standardization, follow the same pattern we used for ChatInterface.
