# Chat Interface Maximize Fix Summary

## Changes Implemented

I've implemented several changes to improve the interface's behavior when the browser is maximized:

### 1. Improved Message Width Handling

All message types now use a smarter width calculation that prevents them from stretching too wide on large screens:

```css
max-width: min(80%, 800px);
```

This was applied to:
- Assistant messages
- User messages
- System messages
- Thought displays
- Media messages
- Tool call displays

### 2. Enhanced Layout Responsiveness

Improved the main layout to better handle maximized windows with responsive padding:

```css
.layout-main-page {
  max-width: 1600px;
  width: 100%;
  margin: 0 auto;
  padding: clamp(1rem, 2vw, 2rem);
  /* ... */
}
```

### 3. Chat Container Optimization

Updated the chat interface container and card with responsive padding and a maximum width constraint:

```css
.chat-interface-container {
  /* ... */
  padding: clamp(0.25rem, 0.5vw, 0.75rem);
}

.chat-interface-card {
  /* ... */
  max-width: 2000px;
  margin: 0 auto;
  width: 100%;
}
```

### 4. Added Large Screen Media Queries

Added specific optimizations for large screens to ensure centered content and appropriate sizing:

```css
@media (min-width: 1600px) {
  .messages-list-container {
    max-width: 90%;
    margin: 0 auto;
  }
  
  .message-item-wrapper {
    max-width: 1400px;
    margin-left: auto;
    margin-right: auto;
  }
}
```

These changes ensure the chat interface maintains proper proportions and readability regardless of screen size, including when the browser is maximized.

## Benefits

1. **Improved Readability**: Messages won't stretch too wide, maintaining optimal reading line length
2. **Better Space Utilization**: Content is properly centered and spaced on large screens
3. **Consistent Experience**: The interface looks good across different window sizes
4. **Professional Appearance**: The layout appears intentionally designed for all screen sizes
