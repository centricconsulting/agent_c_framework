## Next Steps

With the completion of the ChatInputArea component, we have now standardized all the high-priority chat interface components identified in Phase 4 of our plan:

- MessagesList.jsx
- MessageItem.jsx
- AssistantMessage.jsx
- UserMessage.jsx
- SystemMessage.jsx
- ToolCallDisplay.jsx
- ToolCallItem.jsx
