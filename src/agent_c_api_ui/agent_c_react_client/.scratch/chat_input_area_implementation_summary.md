   - Improved focus state styling with a glowing effect
   - Adjusted contrast for better visibility
   - Created a transparent background with proper border

3. **Improved Button Styling**
   - Enhanced button appearance with proper background colors
   - Added hover state effects for better interactivity cues
   - Ensured consistent sizing and positioning

4. **Implemented Visual Hierarchy**
   - Added proper spacing between elements
   - Created a card-like appearance for the input area
   - Ensured dark mode-specific enhancements
