# shadcn/ui Migration Progress Tracker

## Overview
This document tracks the progress of migrating the Agent C React UI components to use the shadcn/ui component library.

## Approach
We're taking an incremental approach, focusing on components that are actively used in the application first. For each component, we're:
1. Analyzing inline styles and CSS variables
2. Extracting inline styles to component CSS files
3. Validating all CSS variables against global definitions
4. Enhancing with shadcn/ui components while maintaining existing functionality
