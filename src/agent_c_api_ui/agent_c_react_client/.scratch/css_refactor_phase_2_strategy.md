# CSS Refactor Phase 2: Strategy Document

## Understanding the CSS Tools

The new CSS tools provided appear to expect a specific structure for component sections. Let's analyze how they work:

### Available CSS Tools

1. `css_overview`: Provides an overview of the CSS file structure and components
2. `css_get_component`: Gets detailed info about a specific component's styles
3. `css_get_component_source`: Gets the raw CSS source for a component
4. `css_get_style_source`: Gets the raw source for a specific style within a component
5. `css_update_style`: Updates a specific CSS class within a component section

### Required CSS Structure (Hypothesis)

Based on the tool behavior and names, it appears the tools expect:

- Clear component sections with standardized markers
- Consistent structure for each component section
- Possibly specific comment formats to identify components

## Proposed New Structure

### Component Section Format

```css
/* ===== COMPONENT: ComponentName ===== */
/* Description: Brief description of the component */
/* Location: src/path/to/Component.jsx */

/* ComponentName: Base styles */
.componentname-container {
  /* styles here */
}

/* ComponentName: Variant styles */
.componentname-variant {
  /* styles here */
}

/* ===== END COMPONENT: ComponentName ===== */
```

### Naming Conventions

1. Class names should follow pattern: `componentname-elementname-variant`
2. Use kebab-case for all class names
3. Component name should be lowercase in class names for consistency
4. Group related styles within a component section

## Implementation Strategy

1. First, test the CSS tools with a small sample to confirm format requirements
2. Create a script or pattern for converting existing sections to new format
3. Apply changes incrementally, one component at a time
4. Test after each component is reformatted
5. After all components are reformatted, perform cleanup and optimization

## Success Criteria

1. CSS tools can identify and work with all component sections
2. No visual regressions in the UI
3. CSS file is more maintainable and better organized
4. Clear documentation exists for future additions
