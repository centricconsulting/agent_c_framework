/* ===== COMPONENT: DragDropArea ===== */
/* Description: Provides file drag and drop functionality with visual feedback */
/* File: src/components/chat_interface/DragDropArea.jsx */

/* NOTE: This component has been migrated to use Tailwind CSS utilities directly in the JSX.
   The following CSS classes have been converted to Tailwind equivalents:
   
   .drag-drop-area → 'relative w-full h-full block'
   .drag-drop-area-disabled → 'pointer-events-none opacity-70'
*/

/* This file is kept as documentation of the migration to Tailwind. */
