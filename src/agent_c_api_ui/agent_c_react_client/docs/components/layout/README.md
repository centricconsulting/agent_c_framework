# Layout Components Documentation

This directory contains documentation for the layout-related components used in the Agent C React UI. These components provide the structural foundation for the application's interface.

## Component List

- [Layout](./layout.md) - Main application layout component
- [AppSidebar](./app-sidebar.md) - Application sidebar navigation
- [PageHeader](./page-header.md) - Header component for page titles and actions

## Layout Structure

The application uses a responsive layout structure with the following key elements:

1. **Sidebar**: Navigation and app controls on the left side
2. **Main Content Area**: Page content on the right side
3. **Header**: Page title and actions at the top (optional)

This structure adjusts for different screen sizes, with the sidebar collapsing on mobile devices.
