# UI Components Documentation

This directory contains documentation for the shadcn/ui-based components used throughout the Agent C React UI.

These components serve as the foundational building blocks for the application interface, providing consistent styling and behavior across the application.

## Component List

- [Button](./button.md) - Core button component with various styles and variants
- [Card](./card.md) - Container component for grouping related content
- [Dialog](./dialog.md) - Modal dialog for displaying content or gathering user input
- [Tabs](./tabs.md) - Interface for switching between different content sections
- [Toast](./toast.md) - Notification component for displaying messages to users

## Usage Guidelines

When using these UI components:

1. Import them from the `@/components/ui` directory
2. Respect their prop interfaces and only pass expected props
3. Use their variant and size props for styling rather than custom CSS when possible
4. Refer to the shadcn/ui documentation for additional customization options
