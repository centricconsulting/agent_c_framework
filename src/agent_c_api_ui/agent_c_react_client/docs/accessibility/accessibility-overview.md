# Accessibility Overview

## Introduction

The Agent C React UI is designed to be accessible to all users, including those with disabilities. This document outlines the approach to accessibility in the application and provides guidelines for maintaining and improving accessibility.

## Accessibility Standards

The application aims to conform to the following standards:

- **WCAG 2.1 Level AA**: Web Content Accessibility Guidelines
- **Section 508**: U.S. federal requirements for accessibility
- **WAI-ARIA 1.1**: Web Accessibility Initiative's Accessible Rich Internet Applications specification

## Key Accessibility Features

### Semantic HTML

The application uses semantic HTML elements to provide meaningful structure:

```jsx
// Good example
<article>
  <header>
    <h2>Message Title</h2>
  </header>
  <section>
    <p>Message content goes here</p>
  </section>
  <footer>
    <time datetime="2023-04-26T14:30">2:30 PM</time>
  </footer>
</article>

// Instead of
<div class="message">
  <div class="message-header">
    <div class="message-title">Message Title</div>
  </div>
  <div class="message-content">
    <div class="message-text">Message content goes here</div>
  </div>
  <div class="message-footer">
    <div class="message-timestamp">2:30 PM</div>
  </div>
</div>
```

### Keyboard Navigation

All interactive elements are keyboard accessible:

- All interactive elements can be accessed using Tab navigation
- Focus indicators are visible and follow a logical order
- Keyboard shortcuts are provided for common actions
- No keyboard traps exist in the UI

### Screen Reader Support

Components are designed to work with screen readers:

- Proper use of ARIA labels and roles
- Alternative text for images
- Announcements for dynamic content changes
- Descriptive link text

### Color and Contrast

The application meets color contrast requirements:

- Text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 against its background (3:1 for large text)
- UI components have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1 against adjacent colors
- Color is never used as the only means of conveying information

## Component-Specific Guidelines

### Chat Interface

- Messages are properly structured with headers and content sections
- Message authors are clearly identified
- New messages are announced to screen readers
- Message types (user, assistant, system) are distinguishable by more than just color

### Navigation

- Skip links are provided to bypass navigation and go to main content
- Current page/section is properly indicated to screen readers
- Navigation items have descriptive labels

### Forms and Inputs

- All form fields have associated labels
- Error messages are linked to their respective inputs
- Required fields are indicated both visually and to screen readers
- Input validation errors are announced to screen readers

### Modals and Dialogs

- Focus is trapped within open modals
- Modals are properly announced to screen readers
- Escape key closes modals
- Modal content is accessible via keyboard

## Testing Accessibility

### Automated Testing

- Automated tests check for basic accessibility issues
- CI/CD pipeline includes accessibility checks

### Manual Testing

- Keyboard-only navigation testing
- Screen reader testing (NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver)
- High contrast mode testing
- Testing with zoomed content (up to 200%)
