      lesson: When adding imports to establish dependency injection, be mindful of
        circular dependencies. Use TYPE_CHECKING imports for type hints when the import
        would create a circular dependency chain. This maintains IDE support and type
        safety while preventing runtime import cycles.

          ✅ Moved AuthService import to TYPE_CHECKING block\n  - Import only executes\

          \ → api.rt → core.services → core.repositories → api.v2 → core.agent_manager\n\
          - TYPE_CHECKING import breaks the chain while preserving type hints\n\n\

          proper cleanup of old connections

          5. **Created `_clear_websocket()` method**: Clears websocket when already

          lifecycle. This enables reconnection support (next task) while maintaining
