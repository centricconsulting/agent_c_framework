# Phase 7.2: OpenAPI Documentation - Session 5 Completion

## Implementation Overview

In this session, I've successfully enhanced the OpenAPI documentation for history endpoints, focusing on improved annotations, comprehensive examples, and detailed documentation of event filtering and replay functionality. This includes updates to both the endpoint code and the markdown documentation.

## What Was Changed

### 1. Enhanced History Models with Examples and Descriptions

I updated all history-related Pydantic models with:

- Expanded, detailed docstrings explaining the purpose and structure of each model
- Comprehensive field descriptions using `Field()` with enhanced description parameters
- Example values using Pydantic's `model_config.schema_extra` mechanism
- Multiple example scenarios showcasing different use cases

Key models enhanced:
- `HistorySummary` - Basic session history information
- `HistoryDetail` - Extended details including event types and metadata
- `EventFilter` - Parameters for filtering history events
- `StoredEvent` - Wrapper for event data with metadata
- `ReplayStatus` and `ReplayControl` - Models for replay functionality

Example of enhanced model:

```python
class EventFilter(BaseModel):
    """
    Parameters for filtering history events
    
    Provides flexible options for filtering session event history by type,
    time range, and limiting the result set size. Used primarily with the
    events retrieval endpoints.
    """
    event_types: Optional[List[str]] = Field(
        None, 
        description="List of event type names to include (e.g., 'text_delta', 'tool_call', 'thinking')"
    )
    # ... additional fields with detailed descriptions
    
    model_config = {
        "json_schema_extra": {
            "examples": [
                # Example 1: Filtering by event type
                { /* Example data */ },
                # Example 2: Filtering by time range
                { /* Example data */ },
                # Example 3: Combined filtering
                { /* Example data */ }
            ]
        }
    }
```

### 2. Improved History Endpoint Documentation

I enhanced the history endpoints with:

- Explicit versioning with the `@version(2)` decorator
- Comprehensive endpoint documentation including request/response examples
- Detailed error response documentation with example responses
- HTTP status code constants from `status` module
- Consistent parameter descriptions and validation
- Improved UUID type handling for session_id parameters

Example of enhanced endpoint annotation:

```python
@router.get(
    "",
    response_model=HistoryListResponse,
    summary="List Session Histories",
    description="List all available session histories with pagination and sorting.",
    responses={
        status.HTTP_200_OK: {
            "description": "Successfully retrieved session histories",
            "content": {
                "application/json": {
                    "example": { /* Detailed response example */ }
                }
            }
        },
        status.HTTP_500_INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR: {
            "description": "Internal server error",
            "content": {
                "application/json": {
                    "example": { /* Error response example */ }
                }
            }
        }
    }
)
@version(2)
```

### 3. Enhanced Events Endpoint Documentation

I improved the events endpoints with:

- Triple-quoted multi-paragraph descriptions for complex endpoints
- Detailed documentation of filtering parameters
- Examples of Server-Sent Events (SSE) streaming responses
- Comprehensive error documentation with structured error responses
- Clear parameter descriptions for replay control

Example of enhanced stream endpoint documentation:

```python
@router.get(
    "/{session_id}/stream",
    summary="Stream Session Events",
    description="""
    Stream events for a session, optionally in real-time.
    
    This endpoint returns a Server-Sent Events (SSE) stream of session events.
    It can be used to watch event history in real-time (with original timing),
    or as fast as possible. The stream format follows the standard SSE format
    with each event containing JSON data for the specific event type.
    
    The real-time option is particularly useful for replaying sessions with
    original timing, while the non-real-time option is better for quickly
    scanning through session history.
    """,
    responses={ /* Detailed response information */ }
)
@version(2)
```

### 4. Comprehensive History API Documentation

I completely overhauled the `docs/api_v2/history.md` file with:

- API overview section explaining the purpose and key features
- Key concepts section explaining sessions, events, filtering, and replay
- Detailed endpoint documentation with request/response formats
- Comprehensive parameter tables with types and descriptions
- Example request/response pairs for each endpoint
- Client integration examples in JavaScript
- Detailed error documentation with status codes and messages
- Event types reference section
- Integration guide for building session replay features

Example sections added:

```markdown
## Key Concepts

### Sessions and Histories

A **session history** represents a complete record of an interaction between a user and the agent. Each history contains multiple events, organized chronologically, that capture everything that happened during the session.

### Events

An **event** is a discrete piece of information about something that happened during a session. Events have different types including:

- **Message events**: User inputs and agent responses
- **Tool call events**: When the agent invokes tools
- **Thinking events**: Internal reasoning processes
- **System events**: Session state changes and metadata updates

// ... additional concept documentation
```

## Documentation Approach

The documentation now follows a consistent pattern for all endpoints:

1. **Endpoint Overview** - Brief description and HTTP method/path
2. **Path Parameters** - All path parameters with types and descriptions
3. **Query Parameters** - Query parameters with detailed descriptions and examples
4. **Request Body** - For POST endpoints, with example JSON for each action type
5. **Response Fields** - Detailed explanation of response properties
6. **Error Responses** - Possible error responses with status codes and examples
7. **Example Usage** - Code examples for client integration

## Next Steps

With the history and replay documentation now complete, the final session will focus on:

1. Session 6: Debug Endpoints and Final Review

This final session will complete the comprehensive documentation for the v2 API, focusing on debug endpoints and performing a thorough review of all documentation to ensure consistency and completeness.
