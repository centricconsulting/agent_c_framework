# v2 API Implementation Step 6.1: Corrections

After review, I identified and fixed an issue with how the APIResponse model was being used in the debug endpoints implementation.

## Issue Found

I was incorrectly using the APIResponse model by setting `status` directly as a string, when the correct approach is to use an APIStatus object with fields like `success`, `message`, and `error_code`.

## Corrections Made

1. **Updated Debug Endpoint Implementation**:
   - Added import for `APIStatus` from response_models
   - Changed all instances of `APIResponse` creation to properly use `APIStatus` objects
   - Updated both the session debug and agent debug endpoints

```python
# Before correction:
return APIResponse(
    status="success",
    message="Session debug information retrieved successfully",
    data=debug_info
)

# After correction:
return APIResponse(
    status=APIStatus(
        success=True,
        message="Session debug information retrieved successfully"
    ),
    data=debug_info
)
```

2. **Updated Tests**:
   - Fixed all test assertions to check `response.status.success` and `response.status.message` instead of directly checking `response.status` and `response.message`

## Verification

I examined other v2 API implementations to confirm the correct usage pattern of APIResponse and APIStatus. The corrections now align with the established patterns used throughout the v2 API.

## Lessons Learned

- Always check the structure of models before implementation
- Follow established patterns from existing code in the project
- Pay close attention to nested objects in response models
