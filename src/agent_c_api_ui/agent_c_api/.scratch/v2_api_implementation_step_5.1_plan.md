# Agent C API V2 - Implementation Step 5.1: Chat Functionality

## Overview

With the core message models now integrated in Step 4.5, we're ready to implement the chat endpoints which provide the central functionality of the API. These endpoints will enable clients to send messages to the agent and receive responses, using our newly integrated core models.

## What We're Changing

We're implementing new RESTful chat endpoints in the v2 API:

1. `POST /api/v2/sessions/{session_id}/chat` - Send a message to the agent
2. `DELETE /api/v2/sessions/{session_id}/chat` - Cancel an ongoing interaction

These endpoints will replace the v1 endpoints `/chat` and `/chat/cancel` with a more RESTful design that's session-scoped.

## Why We're Changing It

1. **Resource-Oriented Structure**: Properly nesting chat operations under sessions follows RESTful principles
2. **Leveraging Core Models**: Using the integrated core models ensures consistency across the system
3. **Improved Error Handling**: Standardizing error responses with proper HTTP status codes
4. **Better Streaming Support**: Enhanced event streaming with Server-Sent Events (SSE)
5. **Enhanced Documentation**: Clearer API documentation with OpenAPI

## How We're Changing It

### 1. Create Chat Router and Endpoints

- Create `/api/v2/sessions/chat.py` module
- Implement session-scoped chat endpoints
- Integrate with SessionService for session management
- Use the core chat message models we integrated in Step 4.5

### 2. Implement Request Handling

- Properly validate incoming chat messages
- Convert API models to core models
- Pass messages to the agent manager
- Handle errors with appropriate status codes

### 3. Implement Response Streaming

- Set up Server-Sent Events (SSE) streaming
- Convert core events to API events
- Include proper event types and formats
- Add cancel functionality

### 4. Add Comprehensive Testing

- Test normal chat flow
- Test streaming responses
- Test error cases and edge conditions
- Test cancel functionality

### 5. Document API Endpoints

- Add OpenAPI annotations
- Include examples
- Document error codes and responses

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Create Router Module

- Create `sessions/chat.py` with router definition
- Add basic route handlers
- Connect to dependencies

### Step 2: Create Chat Service

- Create `ChatService` class to handle business logic
- Implement message sending functionality
- Implement response streaming
- Add cancellation handling

### Step 3: Implement POST Endpoint

- Accept `ChatRequest` model
- Validate session existence and state
- Convert to core models and pass to agent manager
- Setup streaming response if requested
- Return appropriate response format

### Step 4: Implement DELETE Endpoint

- Accept session ID
- Validate session existence
- Call cancellation logic
- Return success/failure response

### Step 5: Create Test Suite

- Create unit tests for ChatService
- Create endpoint tests for router
- Test streaming and non-streaming scenarios
- Test cancellation

### Step 6: Update Router Registration

- Register chat router with sessions router
- Update OpenAPI tags and descriptions

### Step 7: Update Documentation

- Add detailed docstrings
- Include request/response examples
- Document error scenarios

## Expected Outcome

After completing this implementation, we will have:

1. A fully functional chat endpoint that leverages the core message models
2. Proper streaming of responses with SSE
3. Ability to cancel ongoing interactions
4. Comprehensive tests and documentation
5. A more RESTful and resource-oriented API design

## Potential Challenges

1. **Event Streaming Complexity**: Ensuring proper event stream handling across different client types
2. **Cancellation Edge Cases**: Handling in-flight requests during cancellation
3. **Connection Management**: Handling disconnects and reconnects during streaming
4. **Content Type Handling**: Supporting multimodal message content correctly

## Success Criteria

1. All tests pass
2. Endpoints conform to OpenAPI documentation
3. Streaming responses work correctly with SSE
4. Cancellation works reliably
5. Error cases return appropriate status codes and messages

## Conclusion

Implementing the chat functionality is a crucial step in our API redesign. By leveraging the core models we integrated in the previous step, we'll ensure a consistent and maintainable implementation that follows best practices and provides a solid foundation for client applications.
