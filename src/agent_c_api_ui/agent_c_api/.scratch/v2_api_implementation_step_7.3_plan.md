# Phase 7.3: Client Migration Guide - Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the detailed plan for implementing the Client Migration Guide to help users transition from the v1 API to the v2 API. Since this is a substantial documentation effort covering multiple API resource areas, we'll break it down into multiple focused sessions.

## Background

We've completed the implementation of the v2 API through Phase 7.2 (OpenAPI Documentation). The Client Migration Guide is a critical component to help existing users of the v1 API transition to the new v2 API with minimal disruption to their existing integrations.

## Goals

1. Provide clear mapping between v1 and v2 endpoints
2. Document changes in request/response formats
3. Create example migration code for common operations
4. Identify breaking changes and provide workarounds
5. Suggest migration strategies for different types of integrations

## Multi-Session Approach

We'll tackle this work over 5 focused sessions:

### Session 1: Migration Guide Foundation & Configuration Endpoints
- Create the migration guide document structure
- Document the general migration approach and strategies
- Map configuration endpoints (models, personas, tools)
- Create example code for migrating configuration endpoint calls

### Session 2: Session Management Endpoints
- Map session management endpoints
- Document request/response format changes
- Create example code for migrating session operations
- Identify breaking changes related to session management

### Session 3: Chat & Files Endpoints
- Map chat and file handling endpoints
- Document streaming response differences
- Create example code for chat operations
- Document file operation changes

### Session 4: History & Debug Endpoints
- Map history and replay endpoints
- Document events access and filtering changes
- Map debug endpoints
- Create example code for history operations

### Session 5: Full Guide Review & Completion
- Review entire migration guide for consistency and completeness
- Add migration strategy recommendations
- Create transition timeline suggestions
- Finalize the client migration guide

## Session 1 Detailed Plan (Current Session)

In our first session, we'll focus on creating the foundation of the migration guide and documenting the configuration endpoints migration path.

### Tasks:

1. **Create Migration Guide Document Structure:**
   - Introduction and purpose
   - API overview and major changes
   - General migration strategies
   - Endpoint mapping tables
   - Request/response format changes section
   - Breaking changes section
   - Code examples section

2. **Document Migration Approach and Strategies:**
   - Phased approach options (resource by resource vs. all at once)
   - Testing strategies during migration
   - Handling dependencies between endpoints
   - Backward compatibility considerations

3. **Map Configuration Endpoints:**
   - Create detailed mapping table for `/v1/models` → `/v2/config/models`
   - Create detailed mapping table for `/v1/personas` → `/v2/config/personas`
   - Create detailed mapping table for `/v1/tools` → `/v2/config/tools`
   - Document the new `/v2/config/system` endpoint with no v1 equivalent

4. **Document Configuration Request/Response Format Changes:**
   - Analyze and document differences in response structures
   - Highlight new fields or removed fields
   - Document schema validation changes
   - Document any changes in error responses

5. **Create Example Code Snippets:**
   - Example of migrating v1 model listing to v2
   - Example of migrating v1 persona listing to v2
   - Example of migrating v1 tool listing to v2
   - Example of using the new combined system configuration endpoint

## Output Documents

1. **Planning Document (this file):**
   - `//api/.scratch/v2_api_implementation_step_7.3_plan.md`

2. **Client Migration Guide (to be created):**
   - `//api/docs/api_v2/migration_guide.md`

## Implementation Approach

For each v1 endpoint, we'll analyze:
1. The corresponding v2 endpoint(s)
2. Changes in URL structure and HTTP methods
3. Changes in request parameters
4. Changes in response format
5. New features or capabilities
6. Potential migration challenges

We'll then compile this information into a structured guide with examples to help developers understand the changes and update their code accordingly.

## Next Steps

After completing Session 1:
1. Review the initial migration guide structure and configuration endpoint documentation
2. Proceed to Session 2 to document session management endpoints
3. Continue through all planned sessions
4. Conduct a final review of the complete migration guide

## Session Deliverables

Each session will add to the main migration guide document (`//api/docs/api_v2/migration_guide.md`), building it progressively until it covers all aspects of the API migration.
