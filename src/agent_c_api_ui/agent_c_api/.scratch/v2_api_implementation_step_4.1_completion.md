# Agent C API V2 - Implementation Step 4.1 Completion Report

## Overview

This report details the completion of Phase 4.1: Session History Management from our implementation plan. We have successfully implemented the history endpoints that allow users to list, retrieve, and delete session histories.

## Implemented Components

### 1. Model Definitions

Implemented the following models in `api/v2/history/models.py`:

- **HistorySummary**: Model representing summary information about a session history
- **HistoryDetail**: Model with detailed session history information including file lists and event type counts
- **PaginationParams**: Model for pagination control parameters
- **HistoryListResponse**: Response model for paginated history listings

### 2. Service Implementation

Created the `HistoryService` class in `api/v2/history/services.py` that:

- Wraps the existing v1 `InteractionService` for core functionality
- Provides methods for listing, retrieving, and deleting session histories
- Handles the conversion between v1 and v2 data models
- Implements proper error handling and validation

### 3. Router Implementation

Created a new router in `api/v2/history/router.py` with three endpoints:

- **GET /api/v2/history**: Lists available session histories with pagination and sorting
- **GET /api/v2/history/{session_id}**: Retrieves detailed information about a specific session
- **DELETE /api/v2/history/{session_id}**: Deletes a session history and all its files

### 4. Integration

Updated `api/v2/history/__init__.py` to include the new history router, ensuring proper routing for history-related endpoints.

### 5. Documentation

Created comprehensive API documentation in `docs/api_v2/history.md` with:

- Detailed endpoint descriptions
- Request parameters explanation
- Example responses
- Error case handling

### 6. Tests

Implemented thorough tests in `tests/v2/history/test_history.py` including:

- Tests for listing histories with pagination
- Tests for retrieving specific session histories
- Tests for deleting session histories
- Tests for error handling (404 cases)

## Implementation Details

- The implementation leverages the existing v1 `InteractionService` while providing a more RESTful and consistent v2 API interface
- Error handling is comprehensive with appropriate status codes and error messages
- The API follows RESTful design patterns with proper HTTP methods and status codes
- Documentation clearly explains all endpoints, parameters, and responses

## Next Steps

With the completion of Phase 4.1, we're ready to move on to Phase 4.2: Event Access, which will implement endpoints for retrieving session events with filtering and streaming capabilities.
