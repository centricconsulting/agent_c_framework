# v2 API Implementation Step 5.2: File Management - Completion Summary

## Implementation Overview

I've successfully implemented file management endpoints for the v2 API based on the implementation plan. These endpoints provide RESTful access to file operations within sessions, allowing files to be uploaded, listed, downloaded, and deleted.

## Components Implemented

### 1. Files Endpoint Module

Created `//api/src/agent_c_api/api/v2/sessions/files.py` with the following endpoints:

- **POST `/{session_id}/files`**: Upload a file to a session
  - Uses multipart/form-data for file uploads
  - Returns detailed file metadata
  - Processes files in the background for text extraction
  - Status code 201 (Created) on success

- **GET `/{session_id}/files`**: List all files in a session
  - Returns an array of file metadata objects
  - Includes processing status information

- **GET `/{session_id}/files/{file_id}`**: Get metadata for a specific file
  - Returns detailed information about a single file

- **GET `/{session_id}/files/{file_id}/content`**: Download file content
  - Returns the actual file content with appropriate headers
  - Sets correct content-type based on file MIME type

- **DELETE `/{session_id}/files/{file_id}`**: Delete a file
  - Removes a file from the session
  - Status code 204 (No Content) on success

### 2. Router Integration

Updated `//api/src/agent_c_api/api/v2/sessions/__init__.py` to include the new files router, making the endpoints available in the API.

### 3. Comprehensive Tests

Implemented thorough testing in `//api/src/agent_c_api/tests/v2/sessions/test_files.py` covering:

- Successful operations for all endpoints
- Error handling for non-existent sessions
- Error handling for non-existent files
- Proper response structures and status codes

## Implementation Details

### Reuse of Existing Components

The implementation leverages the existing `FileHandler` class from the core module, which provides robust file operations. This approach maintains compatibility with the existing system while providing a more RESTful API interface.

### Error Handling

Comprehensive error handling has been implemented for all endpoints:

- 404 Not Found: For non-existent sessions or files
- 500 Internal Server Error: For unexpected errors during file operations
- Detailed error messages with appropriate context

### Background Processing

Background tasks are used for:

- Processing uploaded files for text extraction
- Periodically cleaning up expired files based on retention policy

## Testing

The implementation includes 12 test cases covering all endpoints and common error conditions:

- Tests for successful file uploads
- Tests for listing files
- Tests for retrieving file metadata
- Tests for downloading file content
- Tests for deleting files
- Tests for proper error handling when sessions don't exist
- Tests for proper error handling when files don't exist

## Next Steps

1. Review and run the tests to verify the implementation
2. Address any feedback from the review
3. Continue to the next step in the implementation plan (Phase 6: Debug Resources)

## Conclusion

This implementation successfully adds file management capabilities to the v2 API, providing RESTful endpoints for working with files within sessions. The implementation follows best practices for FastAPI development, maintains compatibility with existing systems, and includes comprehensive tests to ensure reliability.
