# Phase 7.3: Client Migration Guide - Session 3 Completion

## Implementation Overview

In this session, I've expanded the client migration guide to include comprehensive documentation for chat and file handling endpoints. This includes mapping all the v1 chat and file endpoints to their v2 equivalents, documenting request/response format changes, and providing example code for migration.

## What Was Accomplished

### 1. Chat Endpoint Mapping

I've created detailed mapping tables and documentation for the following endpoint transitions:

- `POST /api/v1/chat` → `POST /api/v2/sessions/{session_id}/chat`
- `POST /api/v1/cancel` → `DELETE /api/v2/sessions/{session_id}/chat`

For each chat endpoint, I've documented:
- The exact URL mapping and HTTP method changes
- Request format changes (form data to JSON)
- Response structure changes (raw text to structured events)
- Example code showing how to migrate from v1 to v2

### 2. File Management Endpoint Mapping

I've documented the migration path for all file operations:

- `POST /api/v1/upload_file` → `POST /api/v2/sessions/{session_id}/files`
- `GET /api/v1/files/{ui_session_id}` → `GET /api/v2/sessions/{session_id}/files`
- `GET /api/v1/files/{ui_session_id}/{file_id}` → `GET /api/v2/sessions/{session_id}/files/{file_id}/content`
- `DELETE /api/v1/files/{ui_session_id}/{file_id}` → `DELETE /api/v2/sessions/{session_id}/files/{file_id}`
- NEW: `GET /api/v2/sessions/{session_id}/files/{file_id}` (file metadata endpoint)

### 3. Request/Response Format Changes

For each endpoint, I've documented the following changes:

- Transition from form data to JSON structured requests
- Changes in parameter naming and URL structure
- New structured response formats for chat events
- Consistent HTTP status codes (201 for creation, 204 for deletion)

### 4. Streaming Response Handling

I've provided detailed examples of how to migrate from the v1 text streaming to the v2 event-based streaming:

- Parsing JSON events instead of raw text
- Handling different event types (text_delta, tool_call, completion)
- Reconstructing complete responses from incremental updates

### 5. Breaking Changes Section

I've expanded the breaking changes section to include chat and file-specific changes:

- Changes in message format from form-based to structured JSON
- Streaming response format changes to JSON events
- URL structure changes for file operations
- Field naming changes in file responses

## Updated Migration Guide Content

The migration guide has been updated with new sections covering:

1. **Chat Functionality**
   - Message sending and cancellation
   - Streaming response handling
   - Example code for adapting to the new formats

2. **File Management**
   - Upload, list, download, and delete operations
   - New file metadata endpoint
   - URL structure changes and parameter mapping

3. **Breaking Changes**
   - Added detailed section on chat and file breaking changes
   - Guidance on handling the new event-based streaming format

## Next Steps

In the next session (Session 4), we'll focus on:

1. Mapping the history endpoints
   - Event access and filtering
   - History replay functionality

2. Documenting the debug endpoints
   - Session debugging tools
   - Agent state inspection

3. Updating the breaking changes section with history-related changes

4. Creating example code for history operations
