# Phase 7.3: Client Migration Guide - Session 1 Completion

## Implementation Overview

In this session, I've successfully initiated the client migration guide by creating two key documents:

1. A comprehensive plan for implementing the migration guide across multiple sessions (`//api/.scratch/v2_api_implementation_step_7.3_plan.md`)
2. The initial version of the client migration guide document with configuration endpoint mapping (`//api/docs/api_v2/migration_guide.md`)

## What Was Accomplished

### 1. Detailed Implementation Plan

I created a detailed plan that breaks down the migration guide implementation into 5 focused sessions:

- **Session 1**: Foundation and configuration endpoints
- **Session 2**: Session management endpoints
- **Session 3**: Chat and files endpoints
- **Session 4**: History and debug endpoints
- **Session 5**: Full guide review and completion

The plan outlines specific tasks, deliverables, and implementation strategies for each session.

### 2. Migration Guide Document Structure

I established the structure for the migration guide document with the following sections:

- Introduction and purpose
- API overview and major changes
- Migration strategies
- Endpoint mapping tables
- Request/response format changes
- Breaking changes section
- Code examples
- Timeline

### 3. Configuration Endpoints Mapping

I completed the mapping for all configuration endpoints:

- `/api/v1/models` → `/api/v2/config/models`
- `/api/v1/personas` → `/api/v2/config/personas`
- `/api/v1/tools` → `/api/v2/config/tools`
- New endpoint: `/api/v2/config/system`

For each endpoint, I documented:
- The exact URL mapping
- HTTP method changes
- Request parameter changes
- Response format changes
- Example code showing how to migrate from v1 to v2

### 4. Migration Strategies

I documented recommended migration strategies including:

- Phased approach (starting with simplest endpoints)
- Testing strategy (parallel testing, feature parity verification)
- Backward compatibility considerations

## Next Steps

In the next session, we'll focus on mapping the session management endpoints:

1. Create detailed mapping for session creation and management endpoints
2. Document request/response format changes for session operations
3. Create example code for migrating session management
4. Identify breaking changes related to session management

## Summary

This session has established a solid foundation for the migration guide by creating the overall structure and completing the documentation for the configuration endpoints. The guide currently provides clear mapping information for the simplest endpoints (configuration resources), with a structured approach for documenting the remaining endpoints in future sessions.
