# Test Migration Session Tracker

**IMPORTANT LESSONS LEARNED**: 
- We've learned that endpoints may not be handling errors correctly and may need to be fixed as part of this process.
- When testing services that use caching, directly mock the service methods rather than underlying data sources.
- For async tests, ensure you're using @pytest_asyncio.fixture instead of @pytest.fixture.
- Be careful with patching module-level variables that may have already been imported - this won't affect code that has already imported the variable.
- Each test should be completely self-contained with its own setup and teardown to prevent unexpected interactions.
- When working with FastAPI services, pay close attention to the difference between model objects and dictionaries.
- Many models were incorrectly using UUIDs for IDs instead of the company-standard MnemonicSlugs format - we need to check and fix this for all models as we go.
- When writing test assertions for error messages, be flexible and account for slight variations in message formatting between different library versions.

- Cache decorator was causing test failures by preventing mocks from being effective
- Discovered critical issue with test reliability when testing cached services

**Implementation Improvements:**
- Reorganized tests into a proper class structure with appropriate docstrings
- Added pytest markers (unit, config, services)

- Completely redesigned tests to mock at the service method level rather than underlying data sources
- Created test-specific data within each test for better control and independence

**Major Lessons Learned:**
- When testing services that use caching, it's better to mock the service methods directly rather than trying to patch underlying data sources
- Each test should be fully self-contained with its own data and mocks to prevent interaction
- For async tests, use @pytest_asyncio.fixture instead of @pytest.fixture
- Be careful with patching module-level variables that may have already been imported

## Migration Phase Guidelines

### Phase 1: Analysis
- Thoroughly examine the test file and its implementation
- Document all findings, issues, and recommendations
- Create a detailed migration plan

### Phase 2: Migration Planning
- Define specific steps for the migration
- Identify import changes and dependency updates
- Plan for resolving any issues found during analysis

### Phase 3: Migration Execution
- Create the new test file structure
- Update imports and dependencies
- Fix any identified issues
- Ensure all tests are properly structured

### Phase 4: Verification
- Run the migrated tests to verify functionality
- Check for any new issues or regressions
- Document any remaining concerns

## Notes
- Each session should focus exclusively on one file's analysis
- Hard stop after analysis for review and feedback
- Implementation of migration will occur in a separate session
- Keep tracking document updated after each session
