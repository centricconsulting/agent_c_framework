# Phase 7.3: Client Migration Guide - Session 4 Completion

## Implementation Overview

In this session, I've expanded the client migration guide to include comprehensive documentation for history and debug endpoints. This includes mapping the v1 history endpoints to their v2 equivalents, documenting the new debug functionality, and providing example code for migrating from v1 to v2.

## What Was Accomplished

### 1. History Endpoint Mapping

I've created detailed mapping tables and documentation for the following endpoints:

- History listing (new in v2): `/api/v2/history`
- History details (new in v2): `/api/v2/history/{session_id}`
- Event retrieval: `/api/v1/events/{session_id}` → `/api/v2/history/{session_id}/events`
- Event streaming: `/api/v1/events/{session_id}/stream` → `/api/v2/history/{session_id}/stream`
- Replay status: `/api/v1/events/{session_id}/replay-status` → `/api/v2/history/{session_id}/replay` (GET)
- Replay control: `/api/v1/events/{session_id}/replay/control` → `/api/v2/history/{session_id}/replay` (POST)

For each endpoint, I documented:
- The exact URL mapping and HTTP method changes
- Request parameter changes
- Response structure changes
- Example code showing how to migrate from v1 to v2

### 2. Debug Endpoint Documentation

I've documented the new debug endpoints that have no v1 equivalents:

- Session debug information: `/api/v2/debug/sessions/{session_id}`
- Agent debug information: `/api/v2/debug/agent/{session_id}`

For these new endpoints, I provided:
- Detailed endpoint descriptions
- Response structure explanations
- Example code showing how to use these endpoints

### 3. Request/Response Format Changes

For each endpoint, I've documented the following changes:

- Migration to a more RESTful URL structure
- Response wrapping with the consistent `APIResponse` pattern
- Detailed error response format changes
- Pagination implementation for event listings

### 4. Breaking Changes Section

I've expanded the breaking changes section to include history and debug-specific changes:

- History endpoints structure changes
- Event format standardization
- Response wrapping with APIResponse
- New debug endpoints with no v1 equivalents

## Updated Migration Guide Content

The migration guide has been updated with new sections covering:

1. **History Endpoints**
   - Session history listing and details
   - Event retrieval and streaming
   - Replay status and control
   - Example code for migrating from v1 to v2

2. **Debug Endpoints**
   - Session debug information
   - Agent debug information
   - Example code for using new debug endpoints

3. **Breaking Changes**
   - Added detailed section on history and debug breaking changes
   - Guidance on adapting to the new API structure

## Next Steps

In the final session (Session 5), we'll focus on:

1. Reviewing the entire migration guide for completeness and consistency
2. Adding migration strategy recommendations
3. Creating transition timeline suggestions
4. Finalizing the client migration guide

The guide now covers all major aspects of the v2 API, providing comprehensive documentation for developers to migrate their applications from v1 to v2.
