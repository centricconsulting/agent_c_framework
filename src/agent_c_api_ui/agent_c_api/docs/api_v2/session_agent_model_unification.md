# Session and Agent Model Unification

## Overview

Recent updates to the Agent C API v2 have further unified the model structure around sessions and agents. This document explains these changes and how they impact working with the API.

## Key Changes

### 1. Models Moved to `session_models.py`

- `AgentConfig` and `AgentUpdate` models are now authoritatively defined in `session_models.py`
- They're re-exported in `agent_models.py` for backward compatibility
- Applications should import these models directly from `session_models.py`

### 2. MnemonicSlug Format for IDs

- Session IDs now use the MnemonicSlug format (e.g., "tiger-castle", "blue-ocean")
- This replaces the previous UUID format for improved readability and memorability
- All endpoints now expect session IDs in this format

### 3. Clear Relationship Documentation

- Model docstrings now explicitly document relationships between models
- The session model structure clearly shows that agent configuration is an integral part of sessions
- The model registry provides a centralized reference for model relationships

## Impact on Applications

### Code Import Changes

Update your imports to use the authoritative model definitions:

```python
# CORRECT
from agent_c_api.api.v2.models.session_models import SessionDetail, AgentConfig, AgentUpdate

# AVOID (though works due to re-exports)
from agent_c_api.api.v2.models.agent_models import AgentConfig, AgentUpdate
```

### Session ID Format Changes

Applications need to handle the new MnemonicSlug format for session IDs:

```python
# Old format (UUID)
session_id = "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000"

# New format (MnemonicSlug)
session_id = "tiger-castle"
```

### Conceptual Model

This change reinforces the conceptual model that:

1. Sessions are the primary resource in the Agent C platform
2. Each session contains an agent with its configuration
3. The agent configuration can be managed through both session endpoints and dedicated agent endpoints

## Best Practices

### Import Practices

1. Always import `AgentConfig` and `AgentUpdate` from `session_models.py`
2. Use consistent import patterns throughout your codebase
3. Consider using the model registry for dynamic model access

### Documentation

1. Document the MnemonicSlug format in your application code
2. Use descriptive variable names that indicate the ID format

### Integration

1. When working with both sessions and agent configuration, consider using the session endpoints for consistency
2. Leverage the agent-specific endpoints when focusing on agent configuration changes

## Migration

To migrate existing code:

1. Update imports to use `session_models.py` for agent-related models
2. Update code that handles session IDs to use the MnemonicSlug format
3. Review and update any code that assumes UUIDs for session IDs

## Future Direction

This unification of models strengthens the platform's conceptual integrity and sets the stage for:

1. More consistent handling of relationships between resources
2. Better developer experience with more intuitive IDs
3. Clearer documentation and API behavior
