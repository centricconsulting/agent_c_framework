# Test 2: Complex Multi-Agent Query Test

## Test Overview
**Test Date**: January 2024  
**Test Type**: Multi-Dataset Query Validation  
**Dataset**: 50-record expanded logistics dataset  
**Purpose**: Validate complex cross-dataset query capabilities and analytical functions  

## Test Objectives
- Test complex operational queries requiring multiple dataset integration
- Validate Hours of Service (HOS) compliance monitoring across geographical regions
- Assess maintenance scheduling intelligence with active load considerations
- Evaluate revenue analysis and customer profitability reporting capabilities

## Test Queries Executed

### Query 1: HOS Risk Management
**Query**: "Show me all drivers in Texas approaching HOS limits (less than 4 hours remaining drive time) with active loads scheduled for delivery"

**Test Method**: Cross-reference hos_logs.json (HOS data), gps_tracking.json (location), and loads.json (active loads) for Texas-based drivers

### Query 2: Maintenance Conflict Detection
**Query**: "Find all vehicles due for maintenance within 5,000 miles that currently have loads assigned"

**Test Method**: Analyze maintenance_history.json (service schedules), vehicles.json (current mileage), and loads.json (active assignments)

### Query 3: Revenue & Customer Analysis
**Query**: "Calculate total revenue for loads delivered in the last 7 days and identify the top 3 most profitable customers"

**Test Method**: Process loads.json (delivered status, revenue), customers.json (customer details), and date filtering

## Test Results

### ✅ Query 1: HOS Risk Management
**Status**: PASSED  

**Critical Drivers Identified**:
1. **DRV030 - Gonzalez, Maria**
   - Location: I-35 near San Antonio, TX
   - Remaining Drive Time: **3.5 hours (CRITICAL)**
   - Active Load: LD240027 (Petroleum products, San Antonio → Austin)
   - Revenue at Risk: $685.00
   - Vehicle: TRK030 (2019 Peterbilt 579)

2. **DRV044 - Sanchez, Rosa**
   - Location: I-35 near Dallas, TX  
   - Remaining Drive Time: **3.2 hours (CRITICAL)**
   - Active Load: LD240038 (Aggregate, Dallas → Arlington)
   - Revenue at Risk: $265.00
   - Vehicle: TRK044 (2019 Kenworth W990)

**Analysis Success**: System successfully integrated HOS compliance data with geographical location and active load management to identify high-risk scenarios.

### ✅ Query 2: Maintenance Conflict Detection  
**Status**: PASSED

**Key Finding**: **No vehicles within 5,000 miles of maintenance with active loads**

**Closest Maintenance Windows**:
- **TRK006**: 7,000 miles until service (Active load LD240008, $1,150 revenue)
- **TRK001**: 7,500 miles until service (Active load LD240006, $720 revenue)

**Fleet Health Assessment**: Excellent proactive maintenance scheduling prevents conflicts between service needs and operational demands.

### ✅ Query 3: Revenue & Customer Analysis
**Status**: PASSED

**7-Day Revenue Analysis** (Jan 10-17, 2024):
- **Total Delivered Revenue**: $2,650.00
- **Average Revenue per Load**: $883.33
- **Loads Analyzed**: 3 completed deliveries

**Top 3 Most Profitable Customers**:
1. **CUST004 - Industrial Steel Works**: $1,125.00 (42.5%)
   - Load Type: Steel coils
   - Industry: Manufacturing
2. **CUST001 - PetroChemical Industries LLC**: $875.00 (33.0%)
   - Load Type: Liquid chemicals  
   - Relationship: Strategic Partner
3. **CUST002 - Lone Star Construction Co**: $650.00 (24.5%)
   - Load Type: Aggregate
   - Industry: Construction
