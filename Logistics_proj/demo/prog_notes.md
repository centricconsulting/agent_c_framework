# Logistics Demo Dataset Expansion Progress

This file tracks the systematic expansion of the logistics demo dataset from 5 to 50 data points across all JSON files. Each section shows completion status in 10-unit increments to enable resumption from any checkpoint. The expansion maintains data consistency and realistic trucking industry patterns throughout all integrated files.

## Current Expansion Status

**Target Fleet Configuration:**
- **50 Drivers**: 30 owner operators, 20 company drivers
- **50 Vehicles**: Mixed manufacturers (Peterbilt, Freightliner, Kenworth, Volvo, Mack, International)
- **50 Trailers**: 15 tankers, 15 end dumps, 10 flatbeds, 10 dry vans
- **50 Fuel Cards**: All drivers equipped with fleet fuel cards

**Performance Distribution Target:**
- Top performers: 7-8 drivers (15%)
- Above average: 12-13 drivers (25%)
- Average: 17-18 drivers (35%)
- Below average: 10 drivers (20%)
- Poor performers: 2-3 drivers (5%)

**Data Integration Requirements:**
- All driver IDs (DRV001-DRV050) match across all files
- All vehicle IDs (TRK001-TRK050) consistently referenced
- All trailer IDs (TRL001-TRL050) properly assigned
- Customer IDs (CUST001-CUST050) cross-referenced in loads
- Load IDs (LD240001-LD240050+) properly tracked
- GPS coordinates realistic for TX, OK, AR, LA region
- HOS compliance data matches current operational status
- Maintenance records align with vehicle mileage and age
- Fuel transactions reflect realistic purchasing patterns

## What Is Being Done and Why

**Project Objective:** Expand the logistics demo dataset from a 5-unit fleet to a comprehensive 50-unit fleet demonstration that showcases the full capabilities of the multi-agent logistics management system.

**Current Phase:** Systematic expansion of all JSON data files to support 50 trucks, 50 drivers, and 50 trailers with fully integrated operational data including GPS tracking, HOS compliance, maintenance history, fuel transactions, customer relationships, and active load management.

**Why This Matters:** The expanded dataset will demonstrate real-world scalability and provide comprehensive test scenarios for the logistics AI system. It enables testing of complex queries like "show me all drivers in Texas approaching HOS limits" or "generate a profitability report for tanker operations" that require substantial data depth to be meaningful.

**Data Consistency Strategy:** Each expansion maintains cross-file referential integrity (driver-to-vehicle assignments, trailer-to-truck assignments, load-to-customer relationships) while following realistic trucking industry patterns for performance distribution, geographic coverage, and operational scenarios.

**Resumption Instructions:** Any agent can continue from the current checkpoint by examining the checkbox status above, identifying the next incomplete dataset, and expanding it by 10 records while maintaining the established data patterns and ID sequences. Always update the corresponding checkboxes upon completion of each 10-record increment.
