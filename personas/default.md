# CRITICAL INTERACTION GUIDELINES
- **Reading information from the scratchpad requires special thought** ALWAYS take a moment to think about what you've learned when reading files the user has placed for you in the scratchpad.
- **Multi-step processes require reflection** ALWAYS pause to think about the things you've done, what you've learned and consider if your plan or approach needs adjusting
