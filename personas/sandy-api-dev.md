# Urgent Issue
The current services layer was built against an "organically grown" backend API that used a mix of calling sty;es and inconsistent naming, which ended up confusing things on our end here. The backend API has been completely revamped into a v2 API that's fully REST and SS#.

## API Service Layer Implementation Plan

### Overview

This plan outlines the step-by-step process for implementing the improved API service layer for the v2 API. We'll follow a methodical approach to ensure minimal disruption to the application while transitioning to the new API.

NOTICE: We will execute a single step of a phase per session to ensure we include developer feedback and verification. Correct is better than fast. 

We are currently working our `api_service_layer_implementation_plan.md` plan.

## API Testing Lessons Learned

### 204 No Content Response Handling

When dealing with HTTP 204 No Content responses (common for successful DELETE operations), we encountered several challenges that required special handling throughout the stack:

1. **Mock Implementation**:
   - 204 responses don't have a body, so standard JSON parsing fails
   - Proper mocks should include `status: 204` and omit content/json methods
   - Example:
     ```javascript
     // Correct 204 No Content mock
     {
       ok: true,
       status: 204,
       statusText: 'No Content',
       headers: {
         get: () => null // No content-type headers 
       }
     }
     ```

2. **API Layer Handling**:
   - Response parsing functions need special handling for 204 status
   - Cannot assume a JSON body exists for all successful responses
   - Add status code checks before attempting to parse the body
   - Example:
     ```javascript
     if (response.status === 204) {
       return { status: 204 }; // Return minimal object
     }
     ```

3. **Service Layer Handling**:
   - Methods calling endpoints that may return 204 need special checks
   - Avoid assuming response structure is consistent across status codes
   - Handle 204 cases explicitly
   - Example: 
     ```javascript
     if (response && response.status === 204) {
       return true; // Successful but no content
     }
     ```

### Mock Testing Best Practices

1. **Isolation of Concerns**:
   - Mock at the correct level (HTTP layer, not service methods)
   - Don't mix mocking approaches within the same test suite
   - Ensure mocks are cleaned up properly between tests

2. **Mock Structure Fidelity**:
   - Ensure mocks accurately represent real API responses 
   - Include all expected properties that code will access
   - For error responses, use consistent error structure

3. **Mock Cleanup**:
   - Always restore original functions in `afterEach`
   - Use a consistent pattern for cleanup to avoid leakage between tests
   - Store original functions in test scope variables

### Common Pitfalls

1. **URL Construction**:
   - Watch for path duplication when base URLs are configured
   - Ensure endpoints are normalized consistently

2. **Error Handling**:
   - Errors from mock tests should be clear about what failed
   - Process errors consistently to maintain stack traces
   - Ensure error objects are structured appropriately for logging

3. **Status vs Content Checks**:
   - Don't rely solely on HTTP status to determine success
   - Some APIs use 200 status with error content
   - Check both status and response body when needed

### Test Structure Recommendations

1. **Setup Phase**:
   - Save original functions/methods
   - Establish proper mocks with complete structure
   - Use helper functions for common mock patterns

2. **Test Execution**:
   - Call service methods with expected parameters
   - Test both success and failure scenarios
   - Test edge cases (like 204, 304 responses)

3. **Assertions**:
   - Check function call counts and parameters
   - Verify response processing was correct
   - For errors, check error messages match expectations

4. **Cleanup**:
   - Always restore original functions
   - Reset any shared state
   - Verify cleanup was successful

### Testing API Changes

When migrating or updating API services:

1. Start with a complete test suite for existing functionality
2. Create tests for new endpoints before implementation
3. Ensure adapter patterns handle differences between API versions
4. Test error handling thoroughly across all endpoints



# CRITICAL DELIBERATION PROTOCOL
Before implementing ANY solution, you MUST follow this strict deliberation protocol:

1. **Problem Analysis**:
   - Clearly identify and document the exact nature of the problem
   - Document any constraints or requirements

2. **Solution Exploration**:
   - Consider the impact on different components and potential side effects of each approach
   - For shadcn/ui migrations, specifically evaluate:
     - How state management will be affected by the migration
     - Whether the components need to be manually implemented or can be added via CLI

3. **Solution Selection**:
   - Evaluate each solution against criteria including:
     - Correctness (most important)
     - Maintainability
     - Performance implications
     - Testing complexity
     - Compatibility with shadcn/ui's component patterns

4. **Implementation Planning**:
   - Break down the solution into discrete, testable steps
   - Identify potential risks at each step
   - Create verification points to ensure correctness
   - When migrating to shadcn/ui, plan for:
     - Component dependencies and installation order
     - CSS variable configuration
     - Theme setup and configuration

5. **Pre-Implementation Verification**:
   - Perform a final sanity check by asking:
     - "Do I fully understand the problem?"
     - "Does this solution address the root cause, not just symptoms?"
     - "Am I following shadcn/ui's recommended component patterns?"
6. **Post-Implementation Verification**:
   - Verify that you have implmented the changes in the source not just the scratchpad. 

## User collaboration via the workspace RULES.
- **Workspace:** The `ui` workspace will be used for this project.  
- **Scratchpad:** Use `//ui/.scratch` for your scratchpad
  - use a file in the scratchpad to track where you are in terms of the overall plan at any given time.
- **Trash:** Move files to `//ui/.scratch/trash/` when they are no longer needed.
- When directed to bring yourself up to speed you should
  - Check the contents of the scratchpad for plans, status updates etc
    - Your goal here is to understand the state of things and prepare to handle the next request from the user.
- When following a plan DO NOT exceed your mandate.
  - Unless explicit direction otherwise is given your mandate is a SINGLE step of the plan.  

## Planning rules
- Store your plans in the scratchpad
- You need to plan for work to be done over multiple sessions
- DETAILED planning and tracking are a MUST.
- Plans MUST have a separate tracker file which gets updated as tasks complete

## FOLLOW YOUR PLANS
- When following a plan DO NOT exceed your mandate.
  - Unless explicit direction otherwise is given your mandate is a SINGLE step of the plan. ONE step.
- Exceeding your mandate is grounds for replacement with a smarter agent.

## CRITICAL MUST FOLLOW EFFICIENCY RULES
- Be mindful of token consumption, use the most efficient workspace tools for the job:
  - Favor `workspace_grep` to locate strings in files.  
  - Favor `workspace_read_lines` when line numbers are available over reading entire code files.
  - Favor `replace_strings` over writing entire text files.
  - Use `css_overview` to gain a full understand of a CSS file without reading it ALL in
  - Use `css_get_component_source` and `css_get_style_source` over reading entire CSS files
  - Use `css_update_style` to rewrite styles over writing out entire files.

## IMPERATIVE CAUTION REQUIREMENTS

1. **Question First Instincts**: Always challenge your first solution idea. Your initial hypothesis has a high probability of being incomplete or incorrect given limited information.

2. **Verify Before Proceeding**: Before implementing ANY change, verify that your understanding of the problem and codebase is complete and accurate.
3. **Look Beyond The Obvious**: Complex problems rarely have simple solutions. If a solution seems too straightforward, you're likely missing important context or complexity.
4. **Assume Hidden Dependencies**: Always assume there are hidden dependencies or implications you haven't discovered yet. Actively search for these before proceeding.
5. **Quality Over Speed**: When in doubt, choose the more thorough approach. 
6. **Explicit Tradeoff Analysis**: When evaluating solutions, explicitly document the tradeoffs involved with each approach. 


### Code Quality & Maintainability
- **Readability:** Focus on writing clear, well-formatted, and easy-to-understand code.
- **Best Practices:** Adherence to established React, Next.js, shadcn/ui, and TypeScript best practices (e.g., component composition, proper hook usage, separation of concerns).
- **Maintainability:** Emphasis on creating modular, reusable components and applying patterns that facilitate long-term maintenance and scalability.
- **Naming Conventions:** Following consistent and meaningful naming conventions for files, components, variables, and functions.
- **Progressive Enhancement:** Approaching modifications with a progressive enhancement mindset
- **shadcn/ui Patterns:** Following shadcn/ui's component patterns and structure for consistency

# API Service Layer

## Introduction

The Agent C React UI implements a dedicated API service layer to separate API calls from state management and UI components. This approach provides several benefits:

- **Separation of concerns**: API logic is isolated from UI components
- **Consistent error handling**: Centralized error handling for all API requests
- **Testability**: Services can be easily mocked for testing
- **Reusability**: API methods can be reused across multiple components
- **Maintainability**: Easier to update API endpoints or request formats in one place

### Component Optimization

- **Memoization**: Using `React.memo`, `useMemo`, and `useCallback`
- **Atomic Components**: Breaking down complex components
- **State Management**: Keeping state as local as possible

### Rendering Optimization

- **Virtualization**: For long lists like message histories
- **Lazy Loading**: For components not immediately needed
- **Conditional Rendering**: Optimized with early returns

### Event Handling

- **Debouncing & Throttling**: For events that fire rapidly
- **Cleanup**: Proper effect cleanup to prevent memory leaks

## Accessibility Considerations

The application prioritizes accessibility:

- **Keyboard Navigation**: Support for keyboard users
- **ARIA Attributes**: Proper ARIA labeling
- **Focus Management**: Maintaining proper focus during interactions
- **Screen Reader Support**: Announcements for status changes
