# PLANE Integration Error Report

Date: October 16, 2025

## âœ… FIXED ISSUES

The following issues have been successfully fixed by Tim:

### âœ… FIXED: Issue 1 - Cannot Get Issue Details

**Original Error:**
```
ERROR: Failed to get issue: Get issue ab1581be-3cc1-4e7f-999b-c396e7ece4e9 failed: Page not found.
```

**Resolution:** We can now successfully get issue details using `plane_plane_get_issue` with the issue ID.

### âœ… FIXED: Issue 4 - Issue Identifier Mismatch

**Original Issue:**
API uses UUIDs while UI uses sequential identifiers (AC-9), causing reference problems.

**Resolution:** We can now retrieve issues using their sequence IDs via `plane_plane_get_issue_by_identifier` function.

### âœ… FIXED: Issue 5 - Cannot Retrieve Sequence IDs Through API

**Original Issue:**
No way to translate between UUIDs and sequential identifiers (AC-1, AC-2).

**Resolution:** `plane_plane_get_issue_by_identifier` now works with numeric identifiers ("9") and returns both sequence_id and UUID.

## ðŸ”´ REMAINING ISSUES

The following issues still need to be addressed:

### ðŸ”´ Issue 1: Cannot Update Issues

### Error Message
```
ERROR: Unexpected error: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'get'
```

### Reproduction Steps
1. Attempt to update an issue using `plane_plane_update_issue` with:
   ```
   {
     "issue_id": "3fe11042-cdd0-4553-b115-7ea9d15ed14e", 
     "description": "Updated description", 
     "project_id": "dad9fe27-de38-4dd6-865f-0455e426339a"
   }
   ```
2. Error returned: "'NoneType' object has no attribute 'get'"

### Additional Information
- Also tried bulk update via `plane_plane_bulk_update_issues` with similar errors
- We can create basic issues with name, description, and priority only
- Cannot modify any issue fields after creation

### ðŸ”´ Issue 2: Structured Fields Not Supported

### Description
PLANE UI has specific structured fields for important metadata like:
- Due dates
- Start dates
- Labels
- Assignees
- States

However, the API doesn't support these fields properly:

1. When attempting to create an issue with a due date:
   ```
   {
     "project_id": "dad9fe27-de38-4dd6-865f-0455e426339a", 
     "name": "Test with proper due date field", 
     "description": "Testing the due date field.", 
     "priority": "medium", 
     "due_date": "2025-10-20"
   }
   ```

2. The issue is created, but the due_date field is not set or returned in the response

3. This forces users to put important metadata in descriptions or titles as text, rather than in structured fields

### ðŸ”´ Issue 3: Cannot Change Issue States

### Description
One of the most fundamental project management functions - moving issues between workflow states - doesn't work.

### Reproduction Steps
1. Attempted to move an issue from Backlog to In Progress using three different methods:

   a. Direct state update:
   ```
   {
     "issue_id": "e4f66e7e-6592-40ce-8825-ba47abb22c02",
     "state_id": "in_progress",
     "project_id": "dad9fe27-de38-4dd6-865f-0455e426339a"
   }
   ```
   Result: ERROR: Failed to update issue: Update issue e4f66e7e-6592-40ce-8825-ba47abb22c02 failed: HTTP 400

   b. Numeric state ID:
   ```
   {
     "issue_id": "e4f66e7e-6592-40ce-8825-ba47abb22c02",
     "state_id": "3",
     "project_id": "dad9fe27-de38-4dd6-865f-0455e426339a"
   }
   ```
   Result: ERROR: Failed to update issue: Update issue e4f66e7e-6592-40ce-8825-ba47abb22c02 failed: HTTP 400

   c. Bulk state change:
   ```
   {
     "issue_ids": "[\"e4f66e7e-6592-40ce-8825-ba47abb22c02\"]",
     "state_id": "in_progress"
   }
   ```
   Result: Failed with "PlaneClient.update_issue() missing 1 required position"

2. Project statistics show all 9 issues in "Unknown" state, suggesting state system isn't properly exposed in API

### Impact
- Cannot implement basic kanban workflow
- Unable to track issue progress through states
- Cannot reflect actual work status in the system
- Makes project tracking essentially non-functional

## Environment
Project ID: dad9fe27-de38-4dd6-865f-0455e426339a (Agent_C)

## Notes
We've made significant progress with issue retrieval and identification, but three critical limitations remain:

1. Cannot update existing issues at all
2. Cannot properly set or retrieve structured fields (due dates, start dates, labels, etc.)
3. Cannot change issue states (move between backlog, todo, in progress, etc.)

These limitations severely restrict the PLANE integration's usefulness for actual project management. Currently, we can only create basic issues and view them - we cannot set proper metadata fields, update issues after creation, or implement any kind of workflow.
