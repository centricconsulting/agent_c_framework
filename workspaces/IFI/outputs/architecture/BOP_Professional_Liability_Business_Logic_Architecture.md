### Architecture Principles
1. **Domain-Driven Design**: Clear business domain boundaries with ubiquitous language
2. **Business Rule Externalization**: Configurable rules separate from application logic
3. **Event-Driven Processing**: Asynchronous business event handling for complex workflows
4. **CQRS Pattern**: Separated command and query responsibilities for business operations
5. **API-First Design**: Business services exposed through consistent API contracts

## 1. Professional Liability Service Domain Architecture

### 1.1 Service Selection Business Logic
```
Professional Liability Services Domain
├─ Service Categories
│  ├─ Manicures (Category: Nail Services)
│  ├─ Pedicures (Category: Nail Services)  
│  ├─ Waxes (Category: Hair Removal)
│  ├─ Threading (Category: Hair Removal)
│  ├─ Hair Extensions (Category: Hair Services)
│  └─ Cosmetology Services (Category: General Beauty)
├─ Business Logic Components
│  ├─ ServiceSelectionValidator
│  ├─ CoverageCalculator
│  ├─ PremiumEngine
│  └─ ComplianceChecker
└─ Integration Points
   ├─ Coverage Determination API
   ├─ Premium Rating Service
   └─ State Licensing Validation
```

### 1.2 Service Domain Business Rules

**Service Selection Rules**:
- Multiple service selection allowed with checkbox UI pattern
- Services stored as concatenated string for legacy compatibility
- Each service category has specific licensing requirements by state
- Professional liability coverage automatic for any selected service
- Service combination affects risk rating and premium calculation

**Coverage Determination Logic**:
```
IF (any professional liability service selected)
  THEN professional_liability_coverage = TRUE
  AND trigger PremiumCalculation(selected_services, state, business_type)
  AND validate StateLicensingRequirements(services, jurisdiction)
```

**Business Validation Framework**:
- **Service-State Compatibility**: Validate selected services are legally offered in jurisdiction
- **Licensing Requirements**: Check professional licensing requirements per service type
- **Coverage Limits**: Determine appropriate coverage limits based on service risk profiles
- **Premium Impact**: Calculate service-specific premium adjustments

    IF response triggers declination criteria THEN
      - Immediately flag application for declination
      - Terminate underwriting workflow
      - Generate declination reason code
      - Trigger applicant notification
      - Log declination details for audit
      
  Declination Triggers:
    - Question 9003: "Yes" response (hazardous materials)
    - Question 9008: "Yes" response (criminal convictions)  
    - Question 9012: "Yes" response (prior declinations)

ELSE: Flag for manual underwriter review
```

**Subsidiary Risk Assessment Rules**:
```
Rule: "Subsidiary Risk Multiplication Factor"
WHEN: Applicant has subsidiaries (Question 9001 = "Yes")
IF: Subsidiary count > 3
AND: Combined revenue > $5M
THEN: Apply subsidiary risk multiplier = 1.25
AND: Require additional financial documentation
AND: Flag for senior underwriter approval
