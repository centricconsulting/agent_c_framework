## Data Management Specifications

### Data Storage and Retrieval

#### FR-004: String Concatenation Storage Pattern
**Requirement**: The system shall store selected services as a comma-separated string value within the BeauticiansProfessionalLiabilityDescription property.

**Technical Implementation**: Selected services are concatenated with proper comma and space formatting: "Service1, Service2, Service3"

**Business Rule**: Services must be stored in a consistent format to ensure accurate retrieval and processing.

**Source Reference**: `ctl_BOP_App_AdditionalServices.ascx.vb`, Save() method, lines 49-76

#### FR-005: Service Selection Parsing Logic
**Requirement**: The system shall parse stored service descriptions to populate the user interface checkboxes during data retrieval operations.

**Technical Implementation**: Uses uppercase string comparison with Contains() method for robust service identification.

**Business Rule**: The parsing logic must be case-insensitive and handle variations in stored data formatting.

**Source Reference**: `ctl_BOP_App_AdditionalServices.ascx.vb`, Populate() method, lines 32-37

#### FR-006: SubQuote Integration
**Requirement**: The system shall integrate service selections with the SubQuote collection, specifically updating quotes that have BeauticiansProfessionalLiability flag enabled.

**Business Rule**: Service descriptions apply only to SubQuotes with HasBeauticiansProfessionalLiability = True.

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Architecture Patterns

#### Pattern 1: ViewState Management
**Implementation**: LocationIndex property utilizes ViewState for accordion-style navigation and state management.
**Purpose**: Maintains control state across postbacks and user interactions.
**Source Reference**: Lines 7-15, ViewState.GetInt32("vs_LocationIndex", -1)

#### Pattern 2: String Concatenation with Delimiter Logic
**Implementation**: Dynamic string building with conditional comma insertion ensures proper formatting.
**Purpose**: Creates human-readable, parseable service descriptions.
**Source Reference**: Lines 49-76, conditional additionalServices += ", " logic

#### Pattern 3: Case-Insensitive Parsing
**Implementation**: UCase() conversion with Contains() method for robust service identification.
**Purpose**: Handles variations in stored data formatting and ensures reliable retrieval.
**Source Reference**: Lines 29-37, UCase(subquote.BeauticiansProfessionalLiabilityDescription)

#### Pattern 4: Collection Iteration with Conditional Processing
**Implementation**: SubQuotes enumeration with HasBeauticiansProfessionalLiability flag evaluation.
**Purpose**: Applies service updates only to relevant quote components.
**Source Reference**: Lines 26-31 and 78-83, SubQuotes iteration

### Validation and Error Handling

#### Validation Requirements
- Service selection validation occurs through base control validation framework
- Child control validation ensures comprehensive data integrity
- VRValidationArgs framework provides consistent validation patterns

**Source Reference**: `ValidateControl()` method, lines 89-92

### UI/UX Considerations

#### Accordion Interface Integration
- Integrates with standardized accordion UI pattern for consistent user experience
- Supports keyboard navigation and accessibility requirements
- Maintains state across accordion panel interactions

**Source Reference**: `AddScriptWhenRendered()` method, lines 23-26

#### Save Functionality
- Explicit save button provides user control over data persistence
- Event handling prevents event propagation for clean user interaction
- Integrates with parent control save orchestration

**Source Reference**: `lnkSave_Click` event handler, line 95
