# STAKEHOLDER COORDINATION STRATEGY
**Phase 2: WCP Gap Resolution - Insurance Domain Approach**

**Rita (IFI Insurance Domain Specialist)**  
**Coordination Date**: $(date)  
**Objective**: 94% â†’ 100% completeness through strategic stakeholder engagement  

## INSURANCE BUSINESS IMPACT PRIORITIZATION

### **CRITICAL PRIORITY** - Business Logic Foundation
These dependencies directly impact insurance business rule accuracy and regulatory compliance:

**1. MultiState Helper Analysis** ðŸ”´ **HIGHEST BUSINESS IMPACT**
- **Insurance Context**: Multi-state business rules are foundational to WCP regulatory compliance
- **Business Risk**: Without this, we cannot validate 4-state architecture compliance patterns
- **Regulatory Impact**: HIGH - affects IN/IL/KY regulatory variation handling
- **Required From Stakeholder**: Complete multi-state business rule coordination logic

**2. VRControlBase Analysis** ðŸ”´ **CRITICAL FOUNDATION** 
- **Insurance Context**: Base validation patterns affect ALL WCP business logic accuracy
- **Business Risk**: Missing inherited validation could create compliance gaps
- **Implementation Impact**: Affects all 6 Named Individual types and kill questions
- **Required From Stakeholder**: Complete base class validation and business logic patterns

**3. QuickQuoteHelperClass Analysis** ðŸŸ¡ **HIGH OPERATIONAL IMPACT**
- **Insurance Context**: Static data initialization affects user experience and data accuracy
- **Business Risk**: Could impact quote generation and customer workflow
- **Integration Impact**: Affects rating service coordination and cache patterns
- **Required From Stakeholder**: Complete static data loading and initialization patterns

### **ENHANCEMENT PRIORITY** - Complete Picture
These enhance completeness but don't block core business logic understanding:

**4. Rating Service API Documentation** ðŸŸ¢ **MEDIUM BUSINESS IMPACT**
- **Insurance Context**: Error handling and service integration patterns
- **User Experience Impact**: Affects error message presentation and user guidance
- **Required From Stakeholder**: API error catalogs and service contract specifications

**5. JavaScript DoCityCountyLookup Implementation** ðŸŸ¢ **LOW BUSINESS IMPACT**
- **Insurance Context**: Address validation user interface enhancement
- **Business Risk**: LOW - core address validation logic already documented
- **Required From Stakeholder**: JavaScript service implementation details

## STAKEHOLDER IDENTIFICATION STRATEGY

### **Business Logic Stakeholders** (Critical Dependencies)
- **Primary Contact**: Insurance Business Analysts / Product Managers
- **Secondary Contact**: Senior System Architects
- **Focus**: Multi-state business rules, validation patterns, data initialization

### **Technical Documentation Stakeholders** (Enhancement Dependencies)  
- **Primary Contact**: Development Team Leads / Technical Architects
- **Secondary Contact**: API Documentation Teams
- **Focus**: Service specifications, error handling, UI implementation

## ENGAGEMENT STRATEGY

### **Phase 1: Critical Business Logic (Week 1)**
**Consolidated Request Approach** - Single comprehensive request focusing on insurance business impact

**Email Template**:
```
Subject: URGENT - WCP Modernization: Critical Business Logic Documentation Needed

Priority: HIGH - Required for Insurance Compliance Analysis

We're conducting comprehensive WCP application analysis for modernization and have identified 3 critical business logic components requiring documentation for regulatory compliance validation:

1. MultiState Helper Business Rules (HIGHEST PRIORITY)
   - Need: Complete 4-state coordination logic (Governing + IN/IL/KY)
   - Business Impact: Regulatory compliance pattern validation
   - Format: Business rule specifications or technical documentation

2. VRControlBase Validation Patterns (CRITICAL FOUNDATION)
   - Need: Base class validation and business logic inheritance
   - Business Impact: Foundation for all WCP validation accuracy
   - Format: Base class specifications or inherited method documentation

3. QuickQuoteHelperClass Data Patterns (HIGH PRIORITY)
   - Need: Static data loading and initialization logic
   - Business Impact: Quote generation and user workflow accuracy
   - Format: Class specifications or data initialization documentation

Timeline: Required within 5 business days for modernization requirements phase

### **Phase 2: Technical Enhancement (Week 2)**
**Individual Targeted Requests** - Specific technical documentation requests

**Focus**: Rating service and JavaScript implementation details

## VALIDATION APPROACH

### **Insurance Domain Validation Checklist**
When stakeholder responses are received:

âœ… **Multi-State Business Logic Accuracy**
- Validate 4-state architecture alignment with insurance regulatory requirements
- Confirm Illinois variation patterns match regulatory compliance needs
- Verify Kentucky override logic meets state-specific requirements

âœ… **Validation Pattern Completeness**
- Ensure VRControlBase patterns support all 6 Named Individual types
- Validate kill question validation inheritance alignment
- Confirm business rule validation hierarchy accuracy

âœ… **Data Initialization Alignment**  
- Verify QuickQuoteHelperClass supports WCP quote generation workflow
- Validate static data patterns align with rating service integration
- Ensure cache coordination supports multi-state architecture

## SUCCESS METRICS

### **Critical Success Criteria**
- **MultiState Helper**: Complete business rule documentation received
- **VRControlBase**: Base validation pattern specifications received  
- **QuickQuoteHelperClass**: Data initialization patterns documented

### **Quality Validation Standards**
- **Insurance Accuracy**: All responses validated against WCP regulatory requirements
- **Implementation Completeness**: Sufficient detail for requirements generation
- **Business Logic Consistency**: Alignment with existing WCP pattern analysis
