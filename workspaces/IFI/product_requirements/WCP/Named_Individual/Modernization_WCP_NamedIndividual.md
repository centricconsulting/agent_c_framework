## Executive Summary

The Workers' Compensation Policy (WCP) Named Individual control represents a sophisticated endorsement management system that supports six distinct categories of individual-specific coverage modifications across multiple state jurisdictions. This system enables policyholders to precisely customize their Workers' Compensation coverage through inclusions, exclusions, waivers, and rejection mechanisms while maintaining full regulatory compliance with state-specific requirements.

The modernization requirements outlined in this document address complex multi-state routing logic, comprehensive data validation frameworks, advanced CRUD operations management, and regulatory compliance patterns that ensure proper endorsement handling across Indiana, Illinois, Kentucky, and governing state jurisdictions.

## 2. State-Specific Requirements and Regulatory Compliance

### 2.1 Multi-State Architecture Overview
The Workers' Compensation (WCP) Named Individual control implements a sophisticated multi-state routing system to ensure compliance with varying state regulatory requirements for individual coverage endorsements. The system dynamically routes endorsement requests to appropriate state-specific quote objects based on the endorsement type, applicable jurisdiction, and regulatory framework.

This multi-state architecture addresses the complex regulatory landscape where certain endorsements are:
- **Universally applicable** to the governing state of the policy
- **State-specific** and only available in particular jurisdictions
- **Multi-jurisdictional** with defined fallback sequences

### 2.2 Indiana Requirements
**Applicable Endorsements:**
- **Exclusion of Amish Workers**: Unique religious exemption provision recognizing Indiana's Amish community requirements
- **Exclusion of Sole Officer**: Primary jurisdiction for sole officer exclusion endorsement

**Regulatory Context:**
Indiana Workers' Compensation regulations provide specific provisions for religious communities and sole proprietorship structures, requiring specialized endorsement handling to maintain compliance with state exemption rules.

### 2.3 Illinois Requirements
**Applicable Endorsements:**
- **Exclusion of Sole Proprietor (Illinois-Specific)**: State-specific exclusion rules implemented November 27, 2018

**Regulatory Context:**
Illinois maintains distinct sole proprietor exclusion requirements that differ from other states, necessitating Illinois-specific endorsement processing and compliance validation.

### 2.4 Kentucky Requirements
**Applicable Endorsements:**
- **Exclusion of Sole Officer**: Secondary/fallback jurisdiction for sole officer exclusions
- **Rejection of Coverage Endorsement**: Kentucky-specific Workers' Compensation coverage rejection, implemented May 2, 2019

**Regulatory Context:**
Kentucky serves as both a primary jurisdiction for coverage rejection endorsements and a fallback jurisdiction for sole officer exclusions, reflecting the state's flexible approach to Workers' Compensation coverage options.

### 2.5 Multi-State Routing Logic
**Governing State Routing**: Endorsements that represent fundamental policy modifications route to the governing state quote object for universal coverage inclusions and standard waiver provisions.

**State-Specific Routing**: Jurisdiction-specific endorsements route directly to the designated state's quote object for religious/cultural exemptions and state-unique requirements.

**Multi-State with Fallback Routing**: Endorsements available in multiple states implement priority-based routing with Indiana-first preference and Kentucky fallback for sole officer exclusions.

## 3. Data Validation and Quality Requirements

### 3.1 Comprehensive Validation Framework
The WCP Named Individual control implements a comprehensive validation framework to ensure data integrity and regulatory compliance across different endorsement types. The system enforces business rules that vary based on the specific endorsement context (NIType), while maintaining consistent data quality standards for individual identification and classification.

### 3.2 Universal Field Requirements
**Name Field Validation**:
- **Business Rule**: Individual name must be provided for all endorsement types
- **Validation Logic**: System validates that name field contains substantive content (not empty or whitespace only)
- **Error Response**: "Missing Name" message displayed to user
- **Business Impact**: Ensures regulatory compliance and individual identification accuracy

### 3.3 Conditional Field Requirements
**Type Field Validation**:
- **Business Rule**: Individual type classification required only for Inclusion of Sole Proprietors endorsements
- **Default Behavior**: System automatically sets "Sole Proprietor" as default classification when required
- **Validation Logic**: System validates type selection exists when required by endorsement context
- **Error Response**: "Missing Type" message when selection is mandatory but not provided

### 3.4 Advanced Name Handling Requirements
**Placeholder Text Management**:
- **Detection Rules**: System recognizes "INCLUSION NAME", "EXCLUSION NAME", and "REJECTION NAME" as placeholder text
- **Data Population**: System automatically clears placeholder text and populates valid individual names from source data
- **User Experience**: Clear field presentation without confusing placeholder content

**Name Parsing Logic**:
- **Single Name**: Treated as first names for identification purposes
- **Two-Part Name**: Parsed as first and last names following traditional conventions
- **Three-Part Name**: Parsed as first, middle, and last names for complete identification
- **Complex Names**: Names with more than three parts preserved as complete first names to accommodate cultural naming conventions

### 3.5 Error Handling and User Experience
**Environment-Specific Error Management**:
- **Production Environment**: Professional error presentation with actionable guidance for end users
- **Development/Testing Environment**: Enhanced error detail for troubleshooting and quality assurance

**Data Quality Standards**:
- **Completeness**: All required fields must contain substantive data before endorsement processing
- **Consistency**: Individual names maintain consistent formatting across all endorsement types
- **Accuracy**: System validation prevents submission of placeholder or template content as actual data
