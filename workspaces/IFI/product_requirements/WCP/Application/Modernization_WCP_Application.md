## 3. Requirements Framework

### 3.1 Kill Questions Requirements

**Business Purpose**: Kill questions serve as the primary eligibility screening mechanism in the WCP application process, automatically identifying high-risk or ineligible applications before full underwriting review. These questions implement critical business logic to ensure regulatory compliance, maintain risk appetite alignment, and optimize operational efficiency.

#### 3.1.1 Kill Questions Specifications

The WCP application system implements **7 distinct kill questions** with specific business logic, validation rules, and termination criteria. Each question is designed to screen for specific risk factors or eligibility requirements that would make an application unsuitable for WCP coverage.

**Complete Kill Questions Inventory:**

| Question # | Code | Question Text | Type | Section | Source Location |
|------------|------|---------------|------|---------|----------------|
| 1 | 9341 | "Does Applicant own, operate or lease aircraft or watercraft?" | Risk Grade Question | Risk Grade Questions | UWQuestions.vb:1869-1879 |
| 2 | 9086 | "Do/have past, present or discontinued operations involve(d) storing, treating, discharging, applying, disposing, or transporting of hazardous material? (e.g. landfills, wastes, fuel tanks, etc.)" | Risk Grade Question | Risk Grade Questions | UWQuestions.vb:1882-1892 |
| 3A | 9573 | "Do any employees live outside the state(s) of {governingStateString}?" | Kill Question - Multistate Only | Risk Grade Questions | UWQuestions.vb:1894-1911 |
| 3B | 9342 | "Do any employees live outside the state of {governingStateString}?" | Kill Question - Single State Only | Risk Grade Questions | UWQuestions.vb:1912-1925 |
| 4 | 9343 | "Any prior coverage declined, cancelled or non-renewed during the prior 3 years?" | Risk Grade Question | Risk Grade Questions | UWQuestions.vb:1929-1939 |
| 5 | 9344 | "Is the Applicant involved in the operation of a professional employment organization, employee leasing operation, or temporary employment agency?" | Risk Grade Question | Risk Grade Questions | UWQuestions.vb:1942-1952 |
| 6 | 9107 | "Any tax liens or bankruptcy within the last 5 years? (If "Yes", please specify)" | Workers Compensation Kill Question | Workers Compensation | UWQuestions.vb:2220-2233 |

#### 3.1.2 Multistate vs Single State Logic Framework

**Business Rule**: The system dynamically selects between two versions of Question 3 based on the governing states configuration for the application.

**Selection Logic:**
- **Multistate Application (Code 9573)**: Used when the application covers multiple states
  - Question Text: "Do any employees live outside the state(s) of {governingStateString}?"
  - Uses plural "state(s)" and "outside the state(s)"
  - Applied when governing states count > 1

- **Single State Application (Code 9342)**: Used when the application covers only one state
  - Question Text: "Do any employees live outside the state of {governingStateString}?"
  - Uses singular "state" and "outside the state"
  - Applied when governing states count = 1

**Technical Implementation Requirements:**
- System must evaluate governing states count during question rendering
- Dynamic question code assignment based on state count evaluation
- Both questions maintain identical business logic and termination criteria
- Question numbering remains "3." for both versions

#### 3.1.3 Kentucky Override Business Rule

**Special Business Logic**: Kentucky applications receive customized question text that overrides the standard dynamic text generation.

**Kentucky Override Rule:**
- **Trigger Condition**: When Kentucky is included in the governing states
- **Override Text**: "Do any employees live outside the state(s) of Indiana, Illinois, or Kentucky?"
- **Business Purpose**: Reflects specific business arrangement or regulatory requirement for Kentucky market
- **Implementation**: Kentucky override takes precedence over standard {governingStateString} substitution

**Technical Requirements:**
- System must detect Kentucky in governing states list
- Override text replaces dynamic text generation for Kentucky applications
- Override applies to both multistate (9573) and single state (9342) logic paths
- Override text is hardcoded and not subject to dynamic substitution

#### 3.1.4 Dynamic Text Generation Requirements

**{governingStateString} Variable Population:**

The system dynamically populates the {governingStateString} placeholder based on the application's governing states configuration.

**Population Logic:**
- **Single State**: Direct state name substitution (e.g., "Illinois")
- **Multiple States**: Comma-separated state list with proper conjunction (e.g., "Illinois, Indiana, and Ohio")
- **Kentucky Exception**: Override with hardcoded text regardless of other states

**Technical Implementation:**
- Governing states retrieved from application configuration
- String formatting must handle proper grammar for multiple states
- Kentucky detection triggers override logic
- Dynamic text generation occurs at question rendering time

#### 3.1.5 Question Categories and Business Logic

**Risk Grade Questions (Questions 1, 2, 4, 5):**
- **Purpose**: Screen for operational risk factors that impact risk assessment
- **Business Logic**: Focus on activities, operations, and history that indicate elevated risk
- **Processing**: Integrated into risk grade calculation and underwriting evaluation

**Geographic Kill Questions (Questions 3A/3B):**
- **Purpose**: Ensure employee coverage aligns with approved states and regulatory requirements
- **Business Logic**: Prevent coverage for employees outside approved jurisdictions
- **Processing**: Immediate application termination if answered "Yes"

**Workers Compensation Kill Questions (Question 6):**
- **Purpose**: Screen for financial stability indicators specific to WCP coverage
- **Business Logic**: Tax liens and bankruptcy indicate financial instability risk
- **Processing**: Located in separate Workers Compensation section with distinct numbering

#### 3.1.6 Response Validation and Processing Logic

**Answer Options:**
- **Standard Response**: Yes/No radio button selection required for all questions
- **Question 6 Special Handling**: Includes "(If "Yes", please specify)" requiring additional text input

**Validation Rules:**
- All kill questions require mandatory response before application progression
- No null or blank responses permitted
- Question 6 "Yes" responses must include specification text
- Response validation occurs before question sequence advancement

**Processing Logic:**
- **"Yes" Response**: Triggers kill criteria evaluation and potential application termination
- **"No" Response**: Allows application progression to next question or section
- **Kill Termination**: "Yes" responses to kill questions immediately terminate application processing
- **Risk Grade Integration**: Responses feed into risk grade calculation for non-kill questions

#### 3.1.7 Kill Criteria and Termination Logic

**Application Termination Conditions:**

All 7 kill questions implement immediate application termination for "Yes" responses:

1. **Question 1 (9341)**: "Yes" = Aircraft/watercraft operations exceed risk appetite
2. **Question 2 (9086)**: "Yes" = Hazardous material operations exceed risk appetite  
3. **Question 3A/3B (9573/9342)**: "Yes" = Geographic coverage scope violation
4. **Question 4 (9343)**: "Yes" = Prior coverage issues indicate elevated risk
5. **Question 5 (9344)**: "Yes" = Professional employment organization operations exceed risk appetite
6. **Question 6 (9107)**: "Yes" = Financial stability concerns exceed risk appetite

**Termination Processing Requirements:**
- Immediate application status change to "Terminated" or "Declined"
- User notification with appropriate business reason messaging
- Application data preservation for audit and reporting purposes
- No progression to subsequent application sections or underwriting
- Termination reason logging for business intelligence and compliance

#### 3.1.8 Question Sequencing and Navigation Logic

**Question Presentation Order:**

**Risk Grade Questions Section:**
1. Question 1 (Code 9341) - Aircraft/Watercraft
2. Question 2 (Code 9086) - Hazardous Materials
3. Question 3A/3B (Code 9573/9342) - Geographic Coverage
4. Question 4 (Code 9343) - Prior Coverage Issues
5. Question 5 (Code 9344) - Professional Employment Organizations

**Workers Compensation Section:**
6. Question 6 (Code 9107) - Financial Stability (Numbered as "23." in section)

**Navigation Requirements:**
- Sequential presentation with mandatory response before advancement
- Kill question termination prevents progression to subsequent questions
- Section-based organization with distinct navigation patterns
- Question numbering reflects section-specific sequences

#### 3.2.2 Core Business Rules Specifications

##### Business Rule BR-001: Multistate Question Code Selection

**Rule Statement**: The system dynamically selects between question codes 9342 and 9573 for the geographic employee coverage question based on the application's multistate capability.

**Business Logic:**
```
IF IsMultistateCapableEffectiveDate(effectiveDate) = True THEN
    Use Question Codes: {9341, 9086, 9573, 9343, 9344, 9107}
    Geographic Question Code: 9573
ELSE
    Use Question Codes: {9341, 9086, 9342, 9343, 9344, 9107}
    Geographic Question Code: 9342
END IF
```

**Rule Details:**
- **Condition**: Evaluated using `IsMultistateCapableEffectiveDate(effectiveDate)` function
- **True Result**: Question code 9573 (multistate version) with plural text "state(s)"
- **False Result**: Question code 9342 (single state version) with singular text "state"
- **Impact**: Determines which version of the geographic coverage question is presented

**Implementation Requirements:**
- System must evaluate multistate capability before question rendering
- Question code assignment must be dynamic based on evaluation result
- Both question versions maintain identical kill logic and termination behavior
- Question numbering remains consistent (Question 3) regardless of code selection

##### Business Rule BR-002: Kentucky Question Text Override

**Rule Statement**: When an application includes Kentucky and meets the effective date criteria, the geographic coverage question text is overridden with Kentucky-specific language regardless of other business rule logic.

**Business Logic:**
```
IF effectiveDate > KentuckyWCPEffectiveDate AND 
   question.text CONTAINS 'LIVE OUTSIDE THE STATE OF' THEN
    Override question text with:
    "Do any employees live outside the state of Indiana, Illinois, or Kentucky?"
END IF
```

**Rule Details:**
- **Primary Condition**: Effective date must exceed Kentucky WCP effective date
- **Secondary Condition**: Question must contain the text pattern 'LIVE OUTSIDE THE STATE OF'
- **Override Text**: Hardcoded text specifying Indiana, Illinois, and Kentucky
- **Priority**: This override takes precedence over dynamic text generation
- **Scope**: Applies to both question codes 9573 (multistate) and 9342 (single state)

**Implementation Requirements:**
- System must detect Kentucky inclusion in application scope
- Date comparison must use configured Kentucky effective date
- Override logic must execute after multistate question code selection
- Hardcoded override text must not be subject to dynamic substitution
- Override must preserve question functionality and kill logic

**Source Traceability:**
- **File**: UWQuestions.vb
- **Lines**: 96-102
- **Context**: Kentucky WC MGB requirement - BRD compliance
- **Analysis Source**: Rex's Technical Analysis - Kentucky Override Logic

---

##### Business Rule BR-003: Multistate Capability Determination

**Rule Statement**: The system determines multistate capability by comparing the application's effective date against the configured multistate start date.

**Business Logic:**
```
IF effectiveDate >= MultiStateStartDate THEN
    IsMultistateCapable = True
ELSE
    IsMultistateCapable = False
END IF

Default MultiStateStartDate = 1/1/2019
```

**Rule Details:**
- **Comparison**: Greater than or equal to (>=) date comparison
- **Default Date**: January 1, 2019 (if not configured)
- **Configuration Source**: VR_MultiState_EffectiveDate appSetting
- **Return Type**: Boolean value determining multistate capability
- **Impact**: Controls question code selection in BR-001

**Implementation Requirements:**
- Date comparison must handle various date formats consistently
- Default value must be applied if configuration is missing or invalid
- Function must return clear boolean result
- Configuration changes must be applied without system restart
- Date validation must prevent invalid effective dates

**Source Traceability:**
- **File**: MultiState/General.vb
- **Lines**: 60-62
- **Context**: Multistate capability determination function
- **Analysis Source**: Rex's Technical Analysis - Date Logic Validation

---

##### Business Rule BR-004: Kentucky WCP Effective Date Configuration

**Rule Statement**: The system maintains a configurable effective date that controls when Kentucky-specific question text overrides become active.

**Business Logic:**
```
KentuckyWCPEffectiveDate = GetConfigValue("WC_KY_EffectiveDate", "8/1/2019")

IF GetConfigValue("WC_KY_EffectiveDate") IS NULL OR INVALID THEN
    KentuckyWCPEffectiveDate = "8/1/2019"
END IF
```

**Rule Details:**
- **Configuration Key**: WC_KY_EffectiveDate
- **Default Value**: August 1, 2019
- **Configuration Location**: appSettings section of app.config/web.config
- **Fallback Logic**: Uses default if configuration is missing or invalid
- **Purpose**: Controls activation of Kentucky question text override

**Implementation Requirements:**
- Configuration must be readable at runtime without restart
- Invalid date formats must trigger default value usage
- Date parsing must handle multiple date format patterns
- Configuration changes must be logged for audit purposes
- Default value must be clearly documented and consistent

**Source Traceability:**
- **File**: MultiState/General.vb
- **Lines**: 30-36
- **Context**: Configuration-driven effective date management
- **Analysis Source**: Rex's Technical Analysis - Configuration Management

#### 3.2.4 Business Rule Interactions and Dependencies

**Rule Interaction Framework**: The 4 business rules and 2 configuration rules form an integrated decision framework that controls WCP kill question behavior through a series of conditional evaluations.

##### Primary Interaction Flow

```
1. Configuration Loading (CR-001, CR-002)
   ↓
2. Multistate Capability Check (BR-003)
   ↓
3. Question Code Selection (BR-001)
   ↓
4. Kentucky Override Evaluation (BR-002)
   ↓
5. Final Question Presentation
```

##### Detailed Interaction Specifications

**Stage 1: Configuration Loading**
- CR-001 loads VR_MultiState_EffectiveDate value
- CR-002 loads WC_KY_EffectiveDate value
- Default values applied for missing/invalid configurations
- Configuration values cached for performance

**Stage 2: Multistate Capability Evaluation**
- BR-003 compares application effective date to CR-001 value
- Returns boolean result determining multistate capability
- Result stored for use in subsequent rule evaluations
- Evaluation occurs once per application processing cycle

**Stage 3: Question Code Selection**
- BR-001 uses BR-003 result to select question code
- Multistate capable = Question Code 9573
- Single state = Question Code 9342
- Question code determines initial text template

**Stage 4: Kentucky Override Check**
- BR-002 evaluates if Kentucky override conditions are met
- Requires: effective date > CR-002 value AND Kentucky coverage
- If conditions met, overrides text from Stage 3
- Override applies to both 9573 and 9342 question codes

**Stage 5: Final Question Presentation**
- Final question text presented to user
- Question functionality remains consistent regardless of text
- Kill logic applies identically to all text variations

##### Rule Dependencies Matrix

| Rule | Depends On | Provides To | Dependency Type |
|------|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| CR-001 | System Configuration | BR-003 | Configuration Input |
| CR-002 | System Configuration | BR-002 | Configuration Input |
| BR-003 | CR-001, Application Data | BR-001 | Boolean Result |
| BR-001 | BR-003 | Question Rendering | Question Code |
| BR-002 | CR-002, Application Data | Question Rendering | Text Override |

##### Critical Decision Points

**Decision Point 1: Multistate Capability**
```
IF Application.EffectiveDate >= Config.VR_MultiState_EffectiveDate THEN
    Multistate_Capable = True
    Next: Use Question Code 9573
ELSE
    Multistate_Capable = False
    Next: Use Question Code 9342
END IF
```

**Decision Point 2: Kentucky Override Activation**
```
IF Application.EffectiveDate > Config.WC_KY_EffectiveDate AND
   Application.States CONTAINS "Kentucky" THEN
    Apply_Kentucky_Override = True
    Next: Use hardcoded Kentucky text
ELSE
    Apply_Kentucky_Override = False
    Next: Use dynamic text generation
END IF
```
