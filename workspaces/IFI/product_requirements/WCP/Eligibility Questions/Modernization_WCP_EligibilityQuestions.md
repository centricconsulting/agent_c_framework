## Executive Summary

The Workers' Compensation Policy (WCP) Eligibility Questions system represents a comprehensive risk assessment and eligibility screening mechanism consisting of **29 total questions** across two distinct categories. This system ensures regulatory compliance and risk management through a sophisticated framework that includes 7 kill questions (automatic disqualification), 22 pure eligibility/underwriting questions, and 2 dual-purpose questions that serve both kill and underwriting functions.

**Complete Question Framework**:
- **29 Total Questions**: Comprehensive eligibility and underwriting assessment
- **7 Kill Questions**: Automatic disqualification triggers (9341, 9086, 9342/9573, 9343, 9344, 9102, 9107)
- **2 Dual-Purpose Questions**: Both kill and underwriting functions (9102, 9107)
- **22 Pure Eligibility Questions**: Standard underwriting assessment (9085, 9087-9101, 9103-9106, 9108)
- **Two Question Categories**: Risk Grade Questions (5) and Workers Compensation Questions (24)

The modernization requirements outlined in this document address complex multi-state question routing logic, comprehensive risk assessment patterns across both categories, dynamic state text generation, and regulatory compliance mechanisms that ensure proper eligibility screening across Indiana, Illinois, Kentucky, and all governing state jurisdictions.

## 1. Business Overview and Risk Assessment Framework

### 1.1 Comprehensive WCP Questions Architecture
The Workers' Compensation Policy eligibility system consists of **29 comprehensive questions** organized into two distinct categories that serve different risk assessment and operational functions:

**Category 1: Risk Grade Questions (5 Questions)**
- Primary function: Automated risk grading and kill question evaluation
- Kill question capability: All 5 questions can disqualify applications
- Coverage: Fundamental risk factors that determine insurability
- Questions: 9341, 9086, 9342/9573, 9343, 9344

**Category 2: Workers Compensation Questions (24 Questions)**
- Primary function: Detailed underwriting assessment and risk evaluation
- Kill question capability: 2 questions also serve as kill questions (9102, 9107)
- Coverage: Comprehensive operational risk factors specific to workers' compensation
- Questions: 9085, 9087-9108 (excluding 9086 which appears in Risk Grade)

### 1.2 Kill Questions Framework (7 Total)
Seven questions across both categories serve as **kill questions** - automated disqualification triggers that prevent policy issuance when specific high-risk conditions are identified:

**Risk Grade Kill Questions (5)**:
- 9341: Aircraft/watercraft ownership
- 9086: Hazardous materials operations
- 9342/9573: Employee location (state-specific variation)
- 9343: Prior coverage declined/cancelled
- 9344: Professional employment organization

**Dual-Purpose Kill Questions (2)**:
- 9102: Prior coverage issues (Kill + Underwriting)
- 9107: Tax liens/bankruptcy (Kill + Underwriting)

**Critical Business Function**: Each kill question represents a binary decision point where a "Yes" answer automatically disqualifies the application while also providing underwriting intelligence for risk assessment.

### 1.3 Dual-Category Question Logic
**Risk Grade vs Workers Compensation Distinction**:
Some risk factors appear in both categories with subtle variations:
- **9085 (WC) vs 9341 (Risk Grade)**: Both assess aircraft/watercraft but different risk contexts
- **9363 (WC) vs 9086 (Risk Grade)**: Both assess hazardous materials but different evaluation criteria
- **Dual-Purpose Integration**: Questions 9102 and 9107 bridge both categories

### 1.4 Universal Application Framework
All 29 questions apply universally across all supported state jurisdictions with specific variations for multi-state capability and Kentucky-specific overrides. The system maintains consistent risk assessment standards while accommodating state-specific regulatory requirements and multi-state operational complexities.

## 3. Multi-State Requirements and Jurisdictional Logic

### 3.1 Multi-State Architecture Overview
The Workers' Compensation Kill Questions system implements sophisticated multi-state routing logic to accommodate policies that operate across multiple jurisdictions while maintaining proper regulatory compliance and risk assessment standards for each applicable state.

### 3.2 Multi-State Capability Determination
**Business Rule**: Multi-state capability is determined by comparing the policy effective date against the configured multi-state start date.

**Logic Implementation**:
- **Multi-State Enabled**: `effectiveDate >= MultiStateStartDate`
- **Single-State Operation**: `effectiveDate < MultiStateStartDate`
- **Default Multi-State Start Date**: January 1, 2019
- **Configuration Control**: VR_MultiState_EffectiveDate application setting

### 3.3 Question Code Selection Logic
**Multi-State Policy Configuration**:
- **Question Codes**: {9341, 9086, 9573, 9343, 9344, 9107}
- **Employee Location Question**: Uses Code 9573 (Multi-State version)
- **State Text Generation**: Dynamic state list via `LOBHelper.AcceptableGoverningStatesAsString()`

**Single-State Policy Configuration**:
- **Question Codes**: {9341, 9086, 9342, 9343, 9344, 9107}
- **Employee Location Question**: Uses Code 9342 (Single-State version)
- **State Text Generation**: Single governing state reference

### 3.4 Kentucky-Specific Override Requirements
**Kentucky Override Logic**:
- **Trigger Condition**: `effectiveDate > KentuckyWCPEffectiveDate AND question contains 'LIVE OUTSIDE THE STATE OF'`
- **Override Text**: "Do any employees live outside the state of Indiana, Illinois, or Kentucky?"
- **Default Kentucky Effective Date**: August 1, 2019
- **Configuration Control**: WC_KY_EffectiveDate application setting

**Business Context**: Kentucky operates within a three-state reciprocal agreement with Indiana and Illinois, requiring specialized question text that reflects this multi-state operational framework.

---

## 4. Configuration Requirements and System Parameters

### 4.1 Configuration Architecture Overview
The Kill Questions system relies on three critical configuration parameters that control multi-state capability, Kentucky-specific overrides, and dynamic state text generation. These configurations enable the system to adapt to changing regulatory requirements and business operational needs.

### 4.2 Multi-State Effective Date Configuration
**Parameter**: `VR_MultiState_EffectiveDate`
**Default Value**: "1-1-2019"
**Purpose**: Controls when multi-state capability becomes available for new policies
**Impact**: Determines whether policies use single-state (9342) or multi-state (9573) employee location questions

**Business Rule**: Policies with effective dates on or after this date receive multi-state question set and routing logic.

### 4.3 Kentucky WCP Effective Date Configuration
**Parameter**: `WC_KY_EffectiveDate`
**Default Value**: "8/1/2019"
**Purpose**: Controls when Kentucky-specific question text overrides become active
**Impact**: Determines when Kentucky policies receive specialized three-state question text

**Business Rule**: Kentucky policies with effective dates after this date receive the Indiana-Illinois-Kentucky question text instead of standard Kentucky-only text.

### 4.4 Dynamic State Text Generation
**Functionality**: `LOBHelper.AcceptableGoverningStatesAsString()`
**Purpose**: Generates dynamic state text for multi-state employee location questions
**Implementation**: Retrieves list of acceptable governing states and formats for question text insertion
**Business Value**: Maintains current state availability without hard-coded state lists in question text

- **Date-Based Routing**: System determines question set based on `IsMultistateCapableEffectiveDate(effDate)`
- **State-Specific Overrides**: Kentucky override logic applies independently to multi-state routing
- **Dynamic Text Generation**: Real-time state text generation for current business rules

### 5.2 Data Persistence Architecture
**Question Response Storage**:
- **Question Code Mapping**: Each kill question maps to specific code for system identification
- **Response Capture**: Binary Yes/No responses with optional specification text for certain questions
- **Audit Trail**: Complete question presentation and response history for regulatory compliance

### 5.3 Business Rules Engine
**Configuration Management**:
- **Application Settings Integration**: Real-time configuration parameter access
- **Date Calculation Logic**: Sophisticated effective date comparison and routing logic
- **Override Processing**: Kentucky-specific text replacement logic with condition evaluation

## 7. Enhanced Validation Rules and Business Logic

### 7.1 Kill Question Response Validation Framework
The WCP Kill Questions system implements comprehensive validation rules that ensure data integrity, regulatory compliance, and user experience consistency across all seven kill questions with their associated "Additional Information" text boxes.

### 7.2 Kill Question Response Logic
**Primary Kill Logic**:
- **"Yes" Response**: Application automatically flagged for kill/declination
- **"No" Response**: Application proceeds through normal underwriting flow
- **No Selection**: Validation error - response required for all kill questions
- **Response Persistence**: All responses logged for audit trail and regulatory compliance

### 7.3 Additional Information Validation Rules
**Conditional Requirement Logic**:
- **Required When**: Text box required ONLY when corresponding kill question answered "Yes"
- **Not Required When**: Kill question answered "No" or left blank
- **Validation Trigger**: Real-time validation on text box blur and form submission
- **Error State Management**: Error cleared immediately when valid text entered

**Text Content Validation**:
- **Minimum Length**: 10 characters required (excluding whitespace)
- **Maximum Length**: 2000 characters (enforced client-side and server-side)
- **Content Filtering**: Basic HTML tag stripping for security
- **Special Characters**: Alphanumeric, punctuation, and standard symbols allowed
- **Prohibited Content**: Script tags, SQL injection patterns blocked

### 7.4 Cross-Question Validation Rules
**Kill Question Interdependencies**:
- **Multiple "Yes" Responses**: All "Yes" responses treated independently (no conflicts)
- **Consistency Checking**: Additional information consistency validated against question context
- **Business Rule Validation**: Additional details validated against known business exclusions
- **Duplicate Response Prevention**: Same response cannot be duplicated across different questions

### 7.5 Form Submission Validation
**Complete Form Validation**:
- **All Kill Questions**: All seven kill questions must have Yes/No responses
- **Required Additional Info**: All "Yes" responses must have completed additional information text boxes
- **Data Integrity**: All responses validated against business rules before submission
- **Error Summary**: Comprehensive error summary displayed if validation fails

**Submission Prevention Logic**:
- **Incomplete Responses**: Form submission blocked until all validation rules satisfied
- **Kill Response Confirmation**: Additional confirmation required when any kill question answered "Yes"
- **Data Loss Prevention**: Auto-save and confirmation dialogs prevent accidental data loss

### 7.6 Server-Side Validation Requirements
**Backend Validation Mirror**:
- **Client-Side Duplication**: All client-side validation rules replicated on server
- **Security Validation**: Additional server-side security and injection prevention
- **Business Rule Enforcement**: Complex business rules validated against current underwriting guidelines
- **Audit Logging**: All validation results logged for compliance and troubleshooting

**Error Response Handling**:
- **Validation Failure**: Detailed error messages returned to client with field-specific guidance
